DTEK said it was the 13th massive attack on Ukrainian energy systems this year, and the 10th to target DTEK power stations. At least one long-time power engineer—Dmytro Petlenko, who worked at one of DTEK’s thermal power plants—was killed during the attacks. Petlenko had reportedly spent more than 30 years working in Ukraine’s energy sector including at the Zaporizhzhia thermal power plant and more recently at another DTEK facility after relocating as a result of the war. The latest Russian attack caused serious damage to Ukraine’s power system, with outages reported across the Dnipropetrovsk, Odessa, and Kyiv regions. DTEK said its teams are still assessing the damage and working to restore power as quickly as possible. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, DTEK said its thermal power plants have endured more than 200 missile, drone, and artillery strikes (Figure 1). Employees work to clean up debris at a DTEK power station after a Russian attack in March 2024. The precise location and date were not disclosed due to security restrictions. Courtesy: DTEK Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, posted on the social platform X, “There are no depths to which russia will not sink. Denying light and warmth to millions of peace-loving people as they celebrate Christmas is a depraved and evil act that must be answered. We appeal to every ally of Ukraine to end this state-sponsored terrorism now by giving our armed forces the air defence ammunition they need to protect essential energy infrastructure.” In late November, the European Commission (EC) and U.S. government agreed to provide aid to DTEK to help keep the lights on in Ukraine. The EC offered €62.8 million while the U.S. added $46.1 million to rebuild capacity destroyed in Russian strikes and to winterize power plants that had been damaged. At the time, DTEK said about 90% of its thermal generation capacity had been affected by attacks over the spring and summer. The EC funding was expected to be used on equipment and materials to restore 1.8 GW of generating capacity, and also to protect power plant equipment from snow, rain, and sub-zero temperatures. The U.S. money was slated to purchase control systems and dozens of new transformers critical to energy supplies. The U.S. had already provided DTEK with important equipment for grid teams, including cherry picker (bucket) trucks, pickups, transformers, and electrical wire, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Meanwhile, world heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk, a native of Ukraine, helped raise global attention on the devastating impact of Russian attacks, as he prepared to defend his title in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, earlier this month. DTEK partnered with Usyk in its #FightForLight campaign to highlight the critical state of Ukraine’s energy system, and to appeal for the urgent delivery of replacement equipment for all Ukrainian energy companies and ammunition for air defense systems. Said Usyk, “Every day, Ukraine’s energy system suffers from brutal Russian attacks. Air defense forces, rescuers, and energy workers are making heroic efforts to ensure Ukrainians have light and warmth in their homes. Let’s support them and remember that we will get through this together. We are the light—Ukrainians who shine for the whole world.” DTEK says in receiving any financial or equipment support, the company adheres to strict anti-corruption and transparency measures, using a process outlined with consultants KPMG. —Aaron Larson is POWER’s executive editor.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Coal-Fired Delaware Plant Will Close Two Years Early\n","Link: https://www.powermag.com/coal-fired-delaware-plant-will-close-two-years-early/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Officials with PJM Interconnection said a coal-fired power unit in Delaware can be closed two years ahead of schedule. The grid operator this month announced the Indian River Unit 4, a 411-MW generator in southern Delaware owned by NRG, can be taken offline without negative impacts to power reliability. The Indian River plant, located in Sussex County and which at one time operated four coal-fired units, first came online in 1957. PJM in an announcement said Delmarva Power, which owns regional transmission, has completed system upgrades supporting grid reliability, enabling the coal-fired unit to shut down 22 months ahead of its scheduled decommissioning date. Delmarva Power on Dec. 18 said it had completed the Vienna-Nelson line upgrade, the last piece of transmission upgrades that will allow Indian River 4 to be retired without creating grid reliability issues. NRG in June 2021 told PJM it wanted to retire Indian River 4 by June 2022. PJM conducted an analysis of grid reliability and at that time said closing the unit would create issues for grid. The grid operator identified several possible transmission upgrades to address those issues, and said it estimated those upgrades could be completed by year-end 2026. PJM in a formal request asked NRG to keep Indian River 4 online under a Reliability Must-Run, or RMR, agreement while those upgrades were being completed. NRG agreed to maintain the coal-fired unit under a rate schedule that was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. PJM has notified NRG of its intent to terminate the RMR arrangement with the grid upgrades completed. The RMR will officially end in February of next year, or 22 months prior to the original end-date of December 2026. That will enable a savings of about two years of RMR payments, estimated at about $93 million according to the settlement rate filed with FERC. “Delmarva’s good work to complete this project far ahead of schedule is a win for our customers, both from a reliability and affordability perspective,” said Mike Bryson, senior vice president-operations at PJM, in a statement. “PJM regards RMR arrangements as a last resort to keep units temporarily operational to maintain system reliability while we make transmission improvements to balance the system, so the sooner we can get the work done, the better.” Unit 4 at Indian River entered commercial operation in 1980. Units 1 and 2, each with about 82 MW of generation capacity, were retired in 2013. The 177-MW Unit 3 at the site was taken offline in 2014. —Darrell Proctor is a senior editor for POWER.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: GE Vernova Wins Major HVDC Contract for South Korea’s Largest Power Grid Infrastructure Project\n","Link: https://www.powermag.com/ge-vernova-wins-major-hvdc-contract-for-south-koreas-largest-power-grid-infrastructure-project/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","GE Vernova said it has been chosen through its joint venture, KAPES, by Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) to deliver its advanced high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) system, based on line commutated converter (LCC) technology, for the 500-kV Donghaean #2 to Dong-Seoul HVDC converter station project (EP2). This project, part of a larger 4-GW HVDC transmission link, is planned to connect South Korea’s power generation complex on the east coast to the Seoul metropolitan area and is intended to be the largest power grid infrastructure initiative in the country’s history. The EP2 project complements the EP1 project, which is also being executed by GE Vernova through KAPES. Together, EP1 and EP2 projects are designed to provide a stable and reliable power supply to the Seoul metropolitan area, which accounts for approximately 40% of South Korea’s energy demand. Both projects are expected to benefit from GE Vernova’s advanced HVDC technology, designed for efficient long-distance power transmission and enhancing grid resilience to meet growing energy needs. GE Vernova’s scope for the EP2 project includes the engineering and delivery of HVDC valves and control systems based on LCC technology, essential for the stable transmission of large-scale power. The project underscores the increasing demand for technology from GE Vernova’s Electrification segment, which continues to grow rapidly. KEPCO is prioritizing advanced HVDC technology as a critical enabler of South Korea’s energy transition. The EP2 project is designed to provide efficient and stable power transmission to key industrial regions while laying the groundwork for a sustainable and resilient energy network. Yu-won Kang, CEO of KAPES, said, “The EP2 project reinforces KAPES’ position as the leading HVDC provider in Korea in collaboration with GE Vernova, further demonstrating its proven technological expertise and project management capabilities. KAPES is proud to support KEPCO in Korea’s energy transition and play a pivotal role in stabilizing the nation’s power grid.” “Our Electrification segment is the fastest-growing part of GE Vernova, with significant growth ahead,” said Johan Bindele, business leader at GE Vernova’s Electrification Systems. “We are committed to delivering innovative solutions that electrify the world while decarbonizing it, as electrification becomes critical for enabling a sustainable and resilient energy future in Asia and beyond. We are proud of our 26-year relationship with KEPCO, our continued collaboration reflects our shared commitment to providing advanced solutions that address the evolving needs of power infrastructure.” “Projects like EP2 are pivotal in enabling South Korea’s energy transition,” said Shailesh Mishra, regional leader of Grid Systems Integration in Asia Pacific at GE Vernova. “By deploying advanced HVDC technology, we are not only enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the country’s grid but also laying the foundation for greater integration of renewable energy. Collaborating with KEPCO through KAPES allows us to deliver transformative solutions that align with South Korea’s vision for a sustainable energy future. KAPES, a joint venture between KEPCO and GE Vernova established in 2012, has been instrumental in delivering various important projects that address South Korea’s unique energy needs. In addition to EP1 and EP2, key initiatives include the Buk-Dangjin-Godeok HVDC Connection, a 3-GW transmission link supplying power from the Dangjin power plant to Seoul and its surrounding regions, and the Shin-Bupyeong HVDC Link, a 500-MW back-to-back voltage sourced converter (VSC) system in Incheon designed to alleviate grid overloads. These projects collectively underscore KAPES’ role in strengthening South Korea’s power grid and advancing its energy infrastructure. HVDC technology is essential in the global shift toward sustainable energy systems as it supports efficient and reliable power transmission over long distances. HVDC systems based on LCC technology use thyristor-based power semiconductors to transfer large amounts of power—up to 8 GW—with low energy losses. These systems’ ability to handle bulk power transmission while providing built-in protection against faults makes them ideal for strengthening South Korea’s power grid and supporting the integration of renewable energy. In South Korea, HVDC aims for enhanced efficiency and stability in transmitting power over long distances, supporting bi-directional energy flow and facilitating renewable energy integration. EP2 is intended to provide a reliable link between the East Coast’s power generation facilities and the high-demand metropolitan area, including semiconductor manufacturing hubs in Yongin, Incheon, and Pyeongtaek. —POWER edited this content, which was contributed by the external communications team of GE Vernova’s Electrification Systems business.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Flamanville 3 Reactor Online in France After 12-Year Delay\n","Link: https://www.powermag.com/flamanville-3-reactor-online-in-france-after-12-year-delay/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","The largest nuclear reactor in France is finally providing power to the country’s grid, more than a decade after it was expected to enter commercial operation. Flamanville 3, an EPR reactor located in Normandy, sustained a series of technical setbacks over the past several years. The 1,600-MW unit, now the most-powerful generating unit in France, began providing electricity on Dec. 21. It was originally expected to come online 12 years ago. Luc Remont, CEO of Électricité de France (EDF), the Paris-based state-owned multinational utility company, in a statement confirmed the startup of Flamanville 3. French President Emmanuel Macron in a statement on social media said it was a “Great moment for the country,” noting the unit is “one of the world’s most powerful nuclear reactors.” Macron added, “Re-industrialising to produce low-carbon energy is ecology French style.” The Flamanville 3 reactor in Normandy, France, entered commercial operation on Dec. 21, 2024. The unit was originally expected to be commissioned 12 years ago.  Courtesy: EDF The first EPR came online in 2018 when Unit 1 at the Taishan site in China entered commercial operation. Two other EPRs are currently in service: Taishan 2 in China, and at Olkiluoto in Finland. The Olkiluoto unit came online last year, 14 years after it was originally intended to be commissioned. Remont said startup of Flamanville 3 is “historic,” noting, “The last time a reactor started up in France was 25 years ago at Civaux 2,” referring to the Civaux power plant in southwestern France. France receives about 62% of its electricity from nuclear power, according to the World Nuclear Association (WNA). The group said the country has nearly 60 operable reactors, with about 64 GW of generation capacity. Flamanville 3’s cost is estimated at about 13.2 billion euros ($13.76 billion), about four times its initial estimated cost of 3.3 billion euros. The reactor was started up on Sept. 3 of this year, but sustained what was called an “automatic shutdown” the next day. That resulted in more testing at the site, and a gradual ramp-up to Saturday’s grid connection. Macron has pledged to add more nuclear power to France’s generation fleet. His government in 2022 ordered six EPR2 reactors, a simplified version of the EPR design. EDF and Framatome are developing the EPR2. Macron has said he is considering options for eight more EPR2 units in addition to the six already ordered. The first six EPR2 reactors are set to be installed in pairs at the Penly, Gravelines, and Bugey power stations. —Darrell Proctor is a senior editor for POWER.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: South Carolina Plant Will Add 180 MW of Gas-Fired Capacity\n","Link: https://www.powermag.com/south-carolina-plant-will-add-180-mw-of-gas-fired-capacity/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Santee Cooper’s board of directors approved the planned expansion of the utility’s Rainey Generating Station as a shared resource with Central Electric Power Cooperative. The additional 180 MW of generation capacity will come from a combined cycle conversion project. Officials on Dec. 20 said the new installation will include two heat recovery steam generators, a steam turbine generator, and other components to capture the waste heat from two existing simple-cycle units at the site. The heat will be used to generate additional electricity. The project requires approval from the South Carolina Public Service Commission. Construction is expected to take about three years. The Rainey facility, located in Iva, S.C., is a 1,000-MW natural gas-fired power plant. Officials said the expansion by utilizing waste heat will not require additional natural gas resources and will not increase the plant’s emissions rate.

The future of the distributed energy generation market is promising, as more commercial and industrial customers, along with residential electricity users, look for cleaner sources of energy. Order 2222, issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2020, also supports DERs after opening U.S. wholesale energy markets to these technologies. Alan Robertson, head of development at Sunrock Distributed Generation, a developer, owner and operator of commercial solar and storage projects, recently provided POWER with his insight about distributed power generation and the future of distributed energy resources. POWER: What government (local, state, federal) policies will support future growth in DERs? Robertson: The key to creating a successful runway for any DER program is predictability, as this builds developer confidence in long-term projects. As long as developers can foresee a clear, multi-year roadmap, they can commit to substantial, long-lead-time projects. This is especially important since many large DER projects, regardless of technology, take several years to build. Federal and state policies primarily drive this predictability, as any meaningful developer of DERs is not just focused on one town, but rather, at the very bare minimum, one whole state, and usually, an entire region. Federal-level policies that we’ve had to support DERs mainly revolve around tax benefits—for example, the ITC (investment tax credit). Future policies should focus on ensuring that we do not lose the 10-year roadmap that was implemented in the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act). It is the reason the industry attracted so much investment,  because for the first time in a long time we had a 10-year federal roadmap. Alan Robertson At the state level there are policies such as net metering that can be helpful to support DER deployment. However, while the way in which different states implement credit systems for energy sent back to the grid varies, the key factor, much like at the federal level, is to provide a long enough runway for stakeholders to invest significant dollars. I’ll point to two different programs. The state of Massachusetts had a Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) incentive, which led to a significant increase in deployed assets. They also had a strong net metering policy at the time. Eventually, they switched to a declining block program, which I’m not particularly fond of, but it still provided a runway that gave investors confidence to continue to commit their dollars. Maine had a program that was probably too good. They went from next to no DERs to practically 60% market penetration within a few years. They expanded a net energy billing program to accommodate larger projects that had limited guardrails upon its enactment. As a result, a lot of people flooded a lot of money into submitting projects for interconnection, only for the legislation to repeatedly amend the program. So, there was a roadmap but due to several amendments the program has slowed to just short of a stop. However, they went from basically no market penetration to 60% in a few years, which is well on the way to meeting the state’s renewable portfolio standard goals. It takes some states a decade or more to get to that point. POWER: What DERs hold the most promise for helping meet commercial/industrial and residential power demand? Robertson: New DER technologies can be challenging to deploy initially, but the ones that are most likely to succeed in the future are those that have already gained traction over the past 10 to 20 years. These include solar energy, and for larger-scale DERs, both offshore and onshore wind energy. Solar will remain a vital part of the DER landscape over the next 10 years, just as it has been over the past decade. Lawmakers, regulators, local building departments and developers have a solid understanding of the technology and its deployment, so they know exactly what they are getting into. Furthermore, significant investments in manufacturing, supply chains, and infrastructure over the last decade have made it easier to integrate solar panels within the existing built environment. Solar is customizable and effectively the same technology for both residential and commercial applications, which further simplifies its deployment. Another DER that has been somewhat quiet in the conversation but will become a louder voice as we move forward is battery storage. As battery technology becomes more deployable and easily integrated with solar energy systems, it holds significant promise. Investments at the state and local level, along with a growing understanding among lawmakers of how to regulate this technology, have increased its viability. For demand response, where predictable and easy-to-deploy solutions are necessary\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Nuclear Startup Seeks Contractors for 6 GW of New Generation\n","Link: https://www.powermag.com/nuclear-startup-seeks-contractors-for-6-gw-of-new-generation/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","The Nuclear Company, which plans to deploy 6 GW of fleet-scale nuclear power across America, on Dec. 19 announced the issuance of a solicitation of interest to contractors in engineering, procurement and construction to support its first fleet. Contractors of all sizes and capabilities are encouraged to request invitations to the formal process. ‍The Nuclear Company, founded earlier this year, has said it is committed to redefining nuclear construction by adopting fleet-scale deployment, which employs a design-once, build-many approach. The approach focuses on streamlining processes, utilizing advanced construction and manufacturing methods, and employing cutting-edge digital technologies. These technologies will integrate advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things to streamline site selection, permitting, construction management, regulatory management, engineering processes and supply chain logistics. Want to learn more about nuclear power? Read this POWER Special Report, featuring information and insight across the entire spectrum of the nuclear industry.  ‍By utilizing this approach, The Nuclear Company aims to achieve significant cost reductions and shortened project timelines, meeting its commitment to on-time, on-budget deployment of its first fleet of 6 GW of nuclear power. Beyond that, the design-once, build-many approach combined with digital technologies ensures an empowered workforce, data-driven decision-making, improved safety and operational excellence. ‍“We look forward to working with partners at the forefront of construction to apply process and digital advancements to nuclear,” said Joe Klecha, The Nuclear Company chief nuclear officer. “The United States will lose its leadership position in nuclear power unless we act quickly to build a resilient American supply chain.” Contractors with experience in large-scale infrastructure construction, as well as providers of emerging/supporting technologies, are invited to express interest at thenuclearcompany.com/soi. Requests for invitations to the formal process will be accepted through Jan. 6, 2025. ‍The Nuclear Company emerged from stealth mode in July with the mission to address America’s surging energy demand driven by AI data computing, onshoring manufacturing, and the electrification of everything. The International Energy Agency projects global electricity demand will increase nearly 30% by 2030, the equivalent of adding the energy requirements of the U.S. and European Union combined. Despite the need for nuclear’s around-the-clock, zero-carbon power, the biggest challenge facing the industry is that one-off nuclear projects almost always are over budget and behind schedule. The Nuclear Company’s model seeks to avoid these pitfalls. ‍The Nuclear Company’s fleet-scale model combines using proven, licensed technology and a design-once, build-many approach to lower costs and minimize delays. The model is anchored by the Industry Working Group of partners that include utilities and independent power producers, hyperscalers, nuclear technology suppliers, and private equity. By joining together, each Industry Working Group member helps mitigate risk and make nuclear power an attractive investment. —POWER edited this content, which was contributed by The Nuclear Company.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Five Critical Insights from NERC’s 2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment\n","Link: https://www.powermag.com/five-critical-insights-from-nercs-2024-long-term-reliability-assessment/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Well over half of North America faces a potential shortage of electricity supplies in the coming years, compounded by surging demand growth, accelerating generator retirements, and delays in resource development, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has warned in its latest 2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment (LTRA). The designated electric reliability organization’s (ERO’s) annual 10-year outlook focused on the North American bulk power system’s reliability paints a sobering picture riddled with interrelated risks. The grid, already grappling with shrinking reliability margins and operational stress from the rapid pace of the energy transition, is ill-equipped to handle the forecasted demand growth, it suggests. Mounting vulnerabilities are rooted in uncertainties, including weather variability and extreme temperatures, the rapid addition of large new loads such as data centers, and persistent delays in generation replacement and transmission development. “Simply put, our infrastructure is not being built fast enough to keep up with the rising demand,” said John Moura, NERC’s director of Reliability Assessments and Planning Analysis. “Collaboration, urgency, and foresight are really not negotiable. Policymakers, industry leaders, and stakeholders across North America must work together to enable the expansion of the bulk power system [and] ensure new resources can interconnect effectively, reliably, and also maintain reliability that society depends on,” he said. Following are the assessment’s most remarkable findings. NERC’s LTRA, a critical tool that informs decision-making across the energy industry, is this year even more dismal than in 2023. In its 2023 LTRA released last year NERC first signaled a reversal of a decades-long trend of falling or flat growth rates for forecasted demand and energy, but it flagged resource adequacy concerns emerging in areas like the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and SERC-Central.  This year’s report suggests risks are pervasive and escalating. NERC identified MISO as the only region considered “high risk”—where established resource adequacy targets may not be in the next five years. However, it marked 10 other regions as “elevated-risk” areas—including some of the largest in the U.S.: PJM, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), California-Mexico, Southwest Power Pool (SPP), and SERC-East. In Canada, all regions—with the exception of WECC-Alberta and NPCC-Quebec—fell into “elevated risk” category, including Ontario, Manitoba, SaskPower, and British Columbia. While these areas will generally meet resource adequacy criteria, “analysis indicates that extreme weather conditions are likely to cause a shortfall in area reserves,” NERC explained.  In the 2024 LTRA, NERC finds that most of the North American bulk power system faces mounting resource adequacy challenges over the next 10 years as surging demand growth continues and thermal generators announce plans for retirement. This graphic shows NERC’s risk map with risk drivers and initial shortfall years. Courtesy: NERC A specific concern for NERC is that, for several regions, initial shortfall years are slated to begin over the next three years—2025 to 2028. The report cites varying risks, ranging from inadequate resource additions and accelerating generator retirements to extreme weather vulnerabilities. NERC noted that one reason for its expanded risk profile this year is that it used both a probabilistic assessment and a reserve margin analysis to assess the risk of future electricity supply shortfalls. “For this year’s assessment, we incorporated more application of energy risk metrics that are capable of finding shortfall risks as the resource mix is changing and there’s more variability in resource output, and also as the demand is becoming more variable in it in future years,” NERC Manager of Reliability Assessments Mark Olson explained on Tuesday. A specific concern underscored in the report is that—keeping pace with the 2023 LTRA—confirmed generator retirements over the next decade will reach 52 GW in 2029 and mark 78 GW over the 10-year period. “Announced retirements, which include many generators that have not begun formal deactivation processes with planning entities, total 115 GW over the 10-year period,” it notes. (That represents about 10% of the 1,189 GW of total installed capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023.) The additional generator retirements—of about 37 GW—”would spur a need for more resources, even more than what we see to address the energy and capacity shortfalls already shown, and that could lead to a reserve margin shortfall in pretty much every area of the North American system between now and the next 10 years,” said Olson. “It really points to the critical need that generator retirements need to be managed in an orderly way and ensure that the reliability and energy needs of the system are taken care of.” NERC’s assessment notes confirmed \n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Understanding Uptime Institute’s Tier III Standard: A Guide to Data Center Electrical System Design\n","Link: https://www.powermag.com/understanding-uptime-institutes-tier-iii-standard-a-guide-to-data-center-electrical-system-design/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","The Uptime Institute’s Tier standard is a globally recognized framework that classifies data centers into four tiers based on their infrastructure’s reliability, redundancy, and fault tolerance. These tiers—Tier I through Tier IV—provide a benchmark for data center performance, ranging from basic infrastructure (Tier I) to fully fault-tolerant systems (Tier IV). Each tier reflects specific design and operational criteria, such as uptime guarantees and maintenance capabilities, enabling businesses to select a standard that aligns with their operational needs and resilience goals. The Tier standard is widely used to ensure consistent and reliable data center performance across industries. The Uptime Institute’s Tier standard classifies data centers into four levels based on their infrastructure’s reliability, redundancy, and fault tolerance. The data center Tier levels are: Each tier aligns with specific operational needs, from basic infrastructure (Tier I) to highly resilient systems (Tier IV). In an era where data is the backbone of modern enterprises, the need for reliable and resilient data centers is more critical than ever. Companies are increasingly turning to the Uptime Institute’s Tier III standard to ensure their data centers achieve high levels of availability and fault tolerance. The Tier III standard, known for its rigorous specifications, has become a popular choice among organizations seeking to minimize downtime and maintain continuous operations. The Uptime Institute’s Tier III standard is designed for data centers that require a high level of availability while allowing for maintainability without interrupting operations. As alluded to above, Tier III data centers must have N+1 redundancy, meaning there is at least one backup component (such as an uninterruptible power supply or generator) for every critical system. This ensures that the facility can undergo routine maintenance or repairs without shutting down operations, making it an ideal solution for businesses that rely on 24/7 access to their data and information technology (IT) systems. Designing an electrical system that meets the Uptime Tier III standard requires careful planning and execution. Below are some essential design solutions to achieve compliance. Redundant Power Distribution Systems. One of the primary requirements of a Tier III data center is a fully redundant power distribution system. This includes dual power sources (A and B) feeding each rack, ensuring that if one power source fails, the other can seamlessly take over. Each power source should have its own independent path, with separate cables, circuit breakers, and switchgear to prevent single points of failure. Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Systems. Tier III data centers need robust UPS systems to maintain power continuity during outages. These systems provide critical power backup for short durations until standby generators can start up. To comply with Tier III standards, the UPS systems should be configured in an N+1 redundant architecture, allowing for one additional unit to be available in case of failure. Standby Generators for Extended Power Outages. In addition to UPS systems, Tier III data centers must have standby generators that can sustain operations during extended power outages. The generators should have enough fuel storage for at least 12 hours of operation and be designed for rapid start-up. Regular testing and maintenance are crucial to ensure these generators are ready to take over immediately when needed. Dual-Corded IT Equipment. To fully leverage the redundancy of the power distribution system, all critical IT equipment within a Tier III data center should be dual-corded. This means each piece of equipment should have two power inputs connected to separate power sources. If one power source fails, the equipment automatically draws power from the other, ensuring uninterrupted functionality. Fault-Tolerant Electrical Design. A fault-tolerant electrical design is essential to meet Tier III standards. This involves implementing measures such as automated transfer switches (ATS) and static transfer switches (STS) to allow seamless switching between power sources without human intervention. Additionally, electrical circuits should be isolated to prevent cascading failures in case of a fault in one section of the system. Regular Maintenance Without Downtime. One of the most significant advantages of a Tier III design is its ability to undergo planned maintenance without impacting operations. This is achieved through redundant infrastructure, allowing sections of the system to be taken offline for maintenance while other sections continue to operate. Proper maintenance protocols and schedules should be established to ensure all components are in optimal condition and backup power systems can sustain operations for a minimum of 72 hours during external outages. Diesel generators, combined with UPS systems, provide this extended runtime.

LCOE measures the average net present cost of electricity generation over a facility’s lifetime. It includes capital costs, fuel costs, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, financing costs, expected capacity factor, and project lifetime. Meanwhile, LVOE goes beyond LCOE by considering the actual value the power provides to the grid, including time of generation (peak vs. off-peak), location value, grid integration costs and benefits, contributions to system reliability, environmental attributes, and capacity value. Some of the key differences stem from the perspective and market context each provides. LCOE, for example, focuses on pure cost comparison between technologies, while LVOE evaluates actual worth to the power system. Notably, LCOE ignores when and where power is generated; whereas, LVOE accounts for temporal and locational value variations. Concerning system integration, LCOE treats all generation as equally valuable, while LVOE considers grid integration costs and system needs. “Things like levelized cost of energy or capacity factors are probably the wrong measure to use in many of these markets,” Karl Meeusen, director of Markets, Legislative, and Regulatory Policy with Wärtsilä North America, said as a guest on The POWER Podcast. “Instead, I think one of the better metrics to start looking at and using more deeply is what we call the levelized value of energy, and that’s really looking at what the prices at the location where you’re trying to build that resource are going to be.” Wärtsilä is a company headquartered in Finland that provides innovative technologies and lifecycle solutions for the marine and energy markets. Among its main offerings are reciprocating engines that can operate on a variety of fuels for use in electric power generating plants. Wärtsilä has modeled different power systems in almost 200 markets around the world. It says the data consistently shows that a small number of grid-balancing gas engines in a system can provide the balancing and flexibility to enable renewables to flourish—all while maintaining reliable, resilient, and affordable electricity. Meeusen noted that a lot of the models find engines offer greater value than other technologies on the system because of their flexibility, even though they may operate at lower capacity factors. Having the ability to turn on and off allows owners to capture high price intervals, where prices spike because of scarcity or ramp shortages, while avoiding negative prices by turning off as prices start to dip and drop lower. “That levelized value is one of the things that we think is really important going forward,” he said. “I think what a lot of models and planning scenarios miss when they look at something like LCOE—and they’re looking at a single resource added into the system—is how it fits within the system, and what does it do to the value of the rest of their portfolio?” Meeusen explained. “I call this: thinking about the cannibalistic costs. If I look at an LCOE with a capacity factor for a combined cycle resource, and don’t consider how that might impact or increase the curtailment of renewable energy—no cost renewable energy—I don’t really necessarily see the true cost of some of those larger, inflexible generators on the system. And, so, when we think about that, we really want to make sure that what we’re covering and capturing is the true value that a generator has in a portfolio, not just as a standalone resource.” Meeusen also suggested another often-used metric might not be as sound as some people believe. “The installed cost per megawatt may also have shortcomings, in terms of, if I build a 100-MW plant, will it give me 100 MW of resource adequacy capacity or will it give me something less than that?” he asked. “The engines don’t derate in the heat. They don’t derate in the cold,” Meeusen said, noting that engines operate and generate effectively in some of the most extreme conditions around the world. Many other power generating technologies cannot say the same thing. “When we think about this in terms of the costs you’re paying for generation, we need to think about how all those costs fit together,” said Meeusen. “Energy, are we getting the levelized value of energy? And installed costs, are we getting the installed cost per megawatt or the installed cost for each megawatt of resource adequacy capacity that I’m building and providing? And I think these are really important elements when we try and balance the entirety of that complex equation that utility planners and system planners have to go through.” To hear the full interview with Meeusen, which includes more about the efficiency engines provide, operational lessons learned, how engines pair with battery storage solutions, multi-fuel opportunities including with \n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Power Engineering - Found 10 articles.\n","\n","Title: Ameren Missouri brings 500 MW of new solar online\n","Link: https://www.power-eng.com/renewables/solar-energy/ameren-missouri-brings-500-mw-of-new-solar-online/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Ameren Missouri announced 500 megawatts (MW) of new solar generation, representing a total investment of approximately $950 million, are now online and serving customers.

However, there are abundant potential use cases for AI in the nuclear sector, a theme of one panel at POWERGEN International, which is February 11-13, 2025, in Dallas, Texas. The panel, “AI in Nuclear: Unfulfilled Promise or Just Getting Started?,” will explore how we can build a foundation for the next wave of AI innovation in nuclear power. It will feature Joshua Guzman Bell, Nuclear Technology & Innovation Consultant for Dominion Energy; Forrest Shriver, CEO of Sentinel Devices; and Greg Alder, Director of Plant Optimization for Curtiss-Wright. Shriver, whose company offers OTAware, a monitoring platform designed to reduce equipment downtime, told Power Engineering he plans to discuss thecutting-edge applications being seen in the nuclear industry, as well as what Sentinel is doing to move AI-driven predictive maintenance forward. “I think it’s very important for power producers to get an understanding of what’s out there and what’s being done at a high level in AI applications for industry, so they can better understand how to parse and judge the trends that are at the heart of the decisions they have to make every day,” said Shriver. “If you know the field, and know how the pieces move, you can be much more prepared to intelligently react and make decisions based on new information.” Shriver highlighted the critical need for offline-first AI solutions to address the unique challenges faced by power producers. These companies often have strict cybersecurity requirements that prevent the use of standard off-the-shelf software, or they operate assets in remote locations where 24/7 data streaming is impractical. Shriver said current AI solutions tend to be cloud-centric, with no clear middle ground between fully on-premises infrastructure and full cloud dependence. “I’ll be talking a bit about how we’re solving that challenge,” he continued, “but I really do think it’s one of the wider unanswered questions at the moment for power producers that are sensitive about cybersecurity.” “AI in Nuclear: Unfulfilled Promise or Just Getting Started?” is scheduled for Thursday, February 13 at 11:30 am – 12:30 pm as part of the Nuclear’s Evolution track.

The 370 megawatt (MW) Great Plains Power Station is now online near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. The plant is powered by Siemens Energy’s SGT6-5000F6.3 gas turbine, SGEN6-1000A generator, SST700-900 steam turbine and SGEN6-100A steam turbine generator. Construction on the plant began in March of 2021. At the peak of construction in July 2023, there were more than 600 workers on site each day. Now up and running, the plant is operated by 25 full-time employees on site. Burns & McDonnell was SaskPower’s engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner for the Great Plains project. We reported back in May that SaskPower planned to invest in new generation as part of a $1.6 billion modernization plan during the 2024-25 fiscal year. The $710 million in investments includes the construction of the Aspen Power Station Project and the Ermine and Yellowhead expansions. The Aspen Power Project will be a 370 MW natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) plant. The project is expected to come online by Spring 2028. Burns & McDonnell was also announced as the EPC.

This has created headaches and financial implications for coal plant operators, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). Over the last two years, U.S. utilities and power producers have collectively accumulated a 138-million-ton stockpile of unused coal at their plants, IEEFA cited from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in a recent analysis. The stockpile matches the entire amount of coal that Appalachia is expected to produce in 2025 and represents $6.5 billion of unused inventory at a time when coal is rapidly being displaced by renewables, IEEFA said. The $6.5 billion figure is based on a $47.22 per ton average cost of coal delivered to plants (including transportation) from January through September of this year. EIA expects stockpiles to remain high, staying well over 100 million tons throughout 2025. Power producers just aren’t burning coal as often. This year, utility-scale wind and solar will produce more power — 665.8 million megawatt-hours (MWh) — than coal for the first time, according to the EIA’s November Short-Term Energy Outlook. Gas-fired generation, which became the dominant fuel in 2016 and now delivers more than 40% of the country’s power, continues to push coal out of competitive power markets. High power demand during winter and summer extremes have historically been key seasons for coal, but utilities and power producers are now getting more of that electricity from renewables and gas. U.S. coal plants now collectively burn just 1 million tons a day, half as much as in 2015, based on the 12-month average through September. At that rate, it would take power producers more than 4 months to use up all the coal sitting around, IEEFA reported. When coal stockpiles previously soared, like in 2009, 2012, 2016, and again in 2020, plant owners worked hard to reduce them to a 50- to 60-day supply, but it took them anywhere from 16 months to almost three years to do it, IEEFA said. But rarely has so much coal lingered for so long as it has currently. The analysis said power companies will need to buy a lot less coal to bring their stockpiles down, even if they keep burning it at the same rate. EIA forecasts coal production output to fall to just 469 million tons in 2025, down from 505 million tons in 2024 and 578 million tons in 2023. Meanwhile, coal continues to fade from the U.S. generation mix. In 2025, IEEFA estimates that another 13 gigawatts (GW) of the remaining 173 GW of coal-fired capacity will either retire or be converted to gas, further reducing the market for coal.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Clean energy deals are down, but interest remains high\n","Link: https://www.power-eng.com/business/clean-energy-deals-are-down-but-interest-remains-high/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","The power and utilities industry closed significantly fewer clean energy deals this year, but steady load growth and state decarbonization initiatives will drive more activity in the sector for years to come, according to a new report. PwC’s Power and utilities: US Deals 2025 outlook notes that only 13 renewable energy deals were done between November 2023 and November 2024, a significant decline from the 27 a year prior. PwC attributes the drop in volume to uncertainty surrounding November’s Presidential election. A second Trump tenure in the White House will most likely come with an uptick in fossil fuel investment and the loss of some environmental protections, but the authors of the report expect renewables to remain a focal point for organic capital investment and do not anticipate wholesale changes to federal support of the sector. The bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act has stimulated billions of dollars in domestic manufacturing investments over the last two years, the majority flowing to Republican-leaning states. PwC notes an increase in fossil fuel generation activity over the past 12 months, which accounted for 19% of total deal value in that span, nearly triple 2023’s level of 7%. Deals within the subsector were driven by an assumed continued need for natural gas infrastructure to ensure reliability via peaker plants- although the first solar-plus-storage peaker plant just came online in California. In the last 12 months, PwC tracked 30 total deals (valued at a combined $27.8 billion) in the power and utilities sector, down from 52 in 2023 ($43.3 billion). Vistra’s $6.3 billion acquisition of Energy Harbor in March accounted for 22.7% of the year’s deal volume. Value propositions in the short-term in the sector remain strong, PwC ultimately concludes, suggesting many strategic, financial, and inbound investors are actively interested in deploying capital. While the renewable energy sector could face short-term uncertainty surrounding future federal incentives like clean infrastructure funding from the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office, many industry experts expect a more strategic review of IRA provisions as opposed to a wholesale reversal. Strategic due diligence will be crucial as dealmakers navigate a shifting regulatory landscape and potential market volatility, the report adds, making it important to stay agile and informed about policy developments as the new Trump Administration begins to take shape. Despite the decline in deals for renewable energy projects, some big ones have still been pushed across the finish line post-election, including financing of a few community solar portfolios. Convergent Energy and Power just closed a programmatic construction-to-term loan, tax equity bridge loan, and letter of credit facility with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group that will accelerate the construction of a portfolio of distributed solar and energy storage projects. The developer expects $150 million in initial funding. Last week, Dimension Energy closed on a major financing package supporting the development of 30 community solar projects across seven states. Dimension secured a $284 million construction and tax equity bridge loan led by First Citizens and closed on a structured equity investment from HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. (HASI) in a new project joint venture.  The Dimension deal closely mirrors one recently announced by fellow community solar developer Pivot Energy, also led by First Citizens Bank and including a joint venture with HASI. First Citizens will supply Pivot with a $450 million debt warehouse that supplies the flexibility needed to continually pump out new projects.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: How can Virginia keep up with extreme data center demand?\n","Link: https://www.power-eng.com/policy-regulation/how-can-virginia-keep-up-with-extreme-data-center-demand-2/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","From leaving co-ops stranded and scrambling to recover costs to accidentally building out too much generation and transmission infrastructure, a lot can go wrong when trying to serve the demand for thousands of new megawatts to feed data centers. A new report examines how Virginia, the data center capital of the world, could both benefit and suffer from the large investments required to meet growing demand. In 2023, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) directed staff to review the impacts of the data center industry in Virginia. Now, JLARC has released its findings in the report, Data Centers in Virginia. In the U.S., data center demand is expected to reach 35 GW by 2030, up from 17 GW in 2022, McKinsey & Company projects. Grid operators and utilities expect to see significant load growth driven by electrification, new manufacturing, and data center development. According to EPRI, 15 states accounted for 80% of data center capacity in 2023, led by Virginia, Texas, California, Illinois, Oregon, and Arizona. That concentration creates economic opportunities for states hosting data centers, but could also stress the grid. Northern Virginia is the largest data center market in the world, constituting 13% of all reported data center operational capacity globally and 25% of capacity in the Americas. According to recent analysis from Upwind, Northern Virginia has a future power requirement of 11,077 MW. Multiple factors have contributed to Northern Virginia’s market prominence, including a strong fiber network, supply of reliable cheap energy, available land, proximity to major national customers, and the creation of a state data center tax incentive. In addition to the benefits associated with new data center development, like tax revenues and construction investments, they are unsurprisingly also expected to drive an “immense” increase in energy demand, the report said. Energy demand in Virginia was “essentially flat” from 2006 to 2020 – and although the population increased during this time, this was offset by energy efficiency improvements, the report said. A report commissioned by JLARC found that “unconstrained demand for power” in the state would double within the next 10 years, mostly from the data center industry.  JLARC argues that building the infrastructure to meet unconstrained data center demand would be “very difficult,” and even trying to meet half of that demand would likely be a struggle. New solar facilities, wind generation, natural gas plants, and increased transmission capacity would all be required to meet unconstrained demand, and the number of projects needed would be “very difficult” to achieve, the report said. New solar facilities would need to be built at twice this year’s annual rate, and the amount of new wind generation required would “exceed the potential capabilities of all offshore wind sites that have so far been secured for future development.”  Even if the state only tries to meet half of unconstrained energy demand, and Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) requirements are not considered, a bottleneck would likely arise in gas generation. New natural gas plants would need to be added at the rate of about one large 1,500 MW plant every two years, for 15 straight years – a cadence not seen since between 2012 and 2018. With VCEA requirements in mind, JLARC says the biggest challenges would be building enough wind, battery storage, and natural gas peaker plants, with no changes to wind generation needs.  The report notes that the projected energy demand increases from data centers have raised concerns about whether enough infrastructure can be built to keep up. PJM currently requires utilities to secure “sufficient generation capacity” plus a reserve margin, and the state requires utilities to develop plans describing how generation capacity needs will be met. However, JLARC argues that individual electric utility planning does not guarantee that the generation resources needed for the whole PJM region will be built since regional generation is not centrally planned. If utilities can’t build enough infrastructure to keep up with demand, they could choose to delay the addition of new large load customers until there is enough generation and transmission capacity on the grid, the report said.  JLARC commissioned an independent study of electric utility cost recoveries under current rate structures and found that data centers are already paying the full cost of service, but growing energy demand is likely to increase costs for other customers as well. The large amount of new generation and transmission that needs to be built will create fixed costs that utilities will need to recover, and the difficulty associated with supplying enough energy to keep pace with growing data center demand means energy prices will likely increase for all customers, the report said. Additionally, if utilities rely on importing power, they will be at the whims of the market and its spik\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Pacific Gas & Electric scores $15B conditional loan to expand hydropower, battery energy storage, and transmission\n","Link: https://www.power-eng.com/renewables/pacific-gas-electric-scores-15b-conditional-loan-to-expand-hydropower-battery-energy-storage-and-transmission/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","California utility Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) has a pretty ambitious wish list this holiday season, but fortunately, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office (LPO) is feeling particularly generous ahead of President-elect Trump retaking office.

Today the LPO announced a conditional commitment for a low-interest loan guarantee of up to $15 billion for PG&E’s Project Polaris, which was submitted to the feds for consideration in June 2023. If finalized, the loan guarantee will support a portfolio of projects to expand hydropower generation and battery storage, upgrade transmission capacity through reconductoring and grid-enhancing technologies, and enable virtual power plants throughout PG&E’s service area. The utility, which serves about 16 million customers in Northern and Central California, says the loan will help it meet forecasted load growth, increase electric reliability, and reduce costs for its rate base. Today’s announcement is the second Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) project under LPO’s flexible loan facility and disbursement approach tailored for regulated, investment-grade utilities. The first was for the restoration and repowering of the Holtec Palisades nuclear plant, slated to become the first shut-down nuke plant to be recommissioned in the United States. Electric utility borrowers for EIR projects must demonstrate that the financial benefits received from the DOE loan guarantee will be passed on to the customers of that utility or the communities it serves. LPO borrowers must develop and implement a comprehensive Community Benefits Plan (CBP), which ensures borrowers meaningfully engage with community and labor stakeholders to create good-paying, high-quality jobs and improve the well-being of the local community and workers. In its CBP, PG&E plans to expand its outreach programs to boost engagement and deliver community benefits in partnership with key stakeholders, including local governments, Native American Tribes, community-based organizations, and low-and-middle-income customers.

In September, Trump pledged to rescind any unspent funds under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the bipartisan infrastructure law that has pumped billions of dollars into the domestic supply chain and clean energy projects from coast to coast. “To further defeat inflation, my plan will terminate the Green New Deal, which I call the Green New Scam,” Trump promised. While it’s understandably easier for the President-elect to reign in unspent funding, he will have a tougher time navigating conditional loan guarantees and virtually no chance of recalling funds that have been distributed. According to the Wall Street Journal, the LPO is expected to extend the loan to PG&E via multiple cash installments spread out over several years, and the funding cannot be withdrawn by subsequent administrations. The LPO has closed on more than a dozen loans so far, totaling more than $13 billion. The LPO has been especially this month, announcing a flurry of new loan activity. Yesterday, it announced $9.63 billion for BlueOval SK to finance the construction of three electric vehicle (EV) battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky. Last week, DOE closed on a $1.25 billion guarantee with EVgo to expand public fast-charging infrastructure nationwide. The week before that was highlighted by a $303.5 million loan guarantee for Eos Energy Enterprises to support two Pennsylvania-based manufacturing facilities developing long-duration batteries. DOE also inked a conditional commitment of up to $7.54 billion with StarPlus Energy, a joint venture between automaker Stellantis and South Korean battery maker Samsung SDI, that will finance two lithium-ion battery cell and module factories in Indiana. According to an analysis by TechCrunch, automakers and battery manufacturers have attracted more than $112 billion via the IRA to build out domestic facilities. The LPO has been granted the authority to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars to innovative clean energy and advanced manufacturing projects. Through September 2024, the office reported financing nearly $44 billion worth to date. As of the EVgo announcement referenced above, that total was closer to $55 billion. Tacking on the billions for BlueOval SK’s battery plants and the PG&E guarantee brings LPO’s total near $90 billion. And there’s more to come. Through November 2024, DOE’s LPO reports more than 200 active applications accounting for more than $324 billion in requested funding.  As of the start of this month, DOE estimated it had around $397 billion left to play around with, including \n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: SWEPCO expands generation capacity with new gas, renewable resources\n","Link: https://www.power-eng.com/gas/swepco-expands-generation-capacity-with-new-gas-renewable-resources/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Southwestern Electric Power Co. (SWEPCO) plans to add multiple natural gas-fired plants, along with new wind and solar farms, pending regulatory approval. The American Electric Power (AEP) subsidiary has proposed adding a 450-Megawatt (MW) natural gas plant to be located at the previously retired H.W. Pirkey Power Plant site in Hallsville, Texas. The new Hallsville plant is expected to come online in 2027, pending approval from utility regulators in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. According to regulatory filings submitted December 17, the facility would feature two GE combustion gas turbine generators and utilize existing water intake structures and site infrastructure to minimize project costs, SWEPCO said. The utility is also planning a coal-to-gas conversion project at the Welsh Power Plant, located northwest of Cason, Texas. The 1,053 MW project would convert the existing coal-fired boilers of Units 1 and 3 to burn natural gas, with Unit 1 conversion anticipated in 2028 and Unit 3 in 2027. Natural gas currently accounts for 48% of SWEPCO’s existing power generation portfolio. Due to the evolving reserve requirements set by the Southwest Power Pool, SWEPCO anticipates an increasing capacity need. In addition to the projects mentioned above, SWEPCO has selected a short-term capacity agreement with a natural gas-fired plant in Texas as part of a competitive bid process. The company said this agreement would serve as a bridge to more permanent resource additions. SWEPCO continues construction on multiple renewable energy projects. The largest one, the 598 MW Wagon Wheel Wind Facility, spans five counties in Oklahoma and is expected to be operational in December 2025. The 200 MW Diversion Wind Farm, located in Baylor County, Texas, is scheduled to begin operations this month. SWEPCO’s first utility-scale solar farm, the 72.5 MW Rocking R Solar Facility, is also nearing completion in Caddo Parish, Louisiana. SWEPCO will not own the facility and will instead purchase the electricity generated via a purchase power agreement.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Eos and FlexGen partnering on first US-made long duration storage solution\n","Link: https://www.power-eng.com/energy-storage/long-duration-energy-storage/eos-and-flexgen-partnering-on-first-us-made-long-duration-storage-solution/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Utilities and independent power producers hoping to capitalize on domestic content tax adders for battery energy storage solutions (BESS) are about to have a game-changing new option for their projects.  Zinc-based long duration energy storage (LDES) systems manufacturer Eos Energy is partnering with battery designer and power systems integrator FlexGen Power Systems to bring the first domestic BESS option to market. Today the companies announced they’ve signed a joint development agreement (JDA) to develop and commercialize America’s first fully integrated, domestic storage solution by combining Eos’ Z3 zinc-bromine batteries with the FlexGen HybridOS Energy Management System (EMS) and a domestic inverter and transformer package. The end result will be a customizable solution for a variety of applications, from grid-scale to behind-the-meter energy storage systems. Justin Vagnozzi, the senior vice president of global sales at Eos Energy, expects this partnership will increase Eos’ reach and deliver more value to customers of both companies by leveraging their combined pipeline of more than 50 gigawatt hours (GWh). “This partnership not only strengthens our go-to-market strategy, but also positions us to deliver an American-made battery storage solution critical to securing America’s energy independence and national security,” Vagnozzi added. North Carolina-based FlexGen utilizes its HybridOS EMS and Lifecycle service team to manage a rapidly growing fleet of energy storage assets for investor-owned utilities, municipal and cooperative utilities, and independent power producers. Over time, Eos expects to source nearly 100% of the materials supply for the Eos Z3 battery from the United States. Domestic clean energy solutions are a hot commodity right now, as the U.S. scales critical manufacturing sectors, spurred by billions of dollars in Inflation Reduction Act investments. Companies are clamoring for domestic storage options in particular. When launched, this integrated solution is expected to deliver a competitive U.S. manufactured option to the market that utilizes the highest level of domestic content available. Eos Energy, founded in Edison, New Jersey, offers an aqueous zinc battery designed to overcome the limitations of conventional lithium-ion, lead-acid, sodium-sulfur, and vanadium redox chemistries for stationary battery storage applications. The company contends its made-in-America solution is safe, scalable, efficient, and sustainable, providing utility, industrial, and commercial customers with 3 to 12-hour applications. The technology of the Z3 is specifically designed for long-duration grid-scale stationary battery storage that can assist in meeting the energy grids’ growing demand with increasing amounts of renewable energy penetration. Critically, Eos batteries are non-flammable and do not require active cooling to operate. The batteries can achieve 100% depth of discharge, do not degrade based on age, and are rated for 6,000 charge/discharge cycles before degradation. Earlier this month, Eos Energy closed on a $303.5 million loan guarantee with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) to finance the construction of two state-of-the-art production lines producing the Eos Z3 in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. Two additional lines in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, may also be included as part of the loan guarantee. All four lines are expected to manufacture 8 GWh of storage capacity annually by 2027, or enough to provide electricity to over 300,000 average U.S. homes instantaneously or meet the annual electricity needs of approximately 130,000 homes if fully charged and discharged daily. The project is expected to create and maintain up to 1000 jobs. According to the latest Energy Storage Monitor report, in the third quarter of 2024, the United States deployed a total of 3,806 MW and 9,931 megawatt-hours MW of energy storage, a new Q3 record and an 80% and 58% increase over the same span in 2023. Most of that fresh capacity came courtesy of utility-connected batteries.  Originally published in Renewable Energy World.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Power Technology - Found 10 articles.\n","\n","Title: TPG Rise Climate in talks for Altus Power acquisition\n","Link: https://www.power-technology.com/news/tpg-rise-climate-altus-power/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","The negotiations could lead to a formal deal in the forthcoming weeks, the sources stated, though a deal has not been finalised.

Earlier this month, Panasonic inaugurated its RE100 facility in Cardiff, Wales, which will run entirely on renewable energy. The 50-year-old retrofitted site will utilise a combination of hydrogen fuel cells, solar power and battery storage, coordinated by Panasonic’s energy management system (EMS).  Hydrogen serves a key role at the facility, as the heat produced from the fuel cells as a byproduct of electricity production will also be used to heat spaces and water. The energy source has gained prominence in recent years as a key player in the global energy transition.  \n","                        The gold standard of business intelligence.\n","                     \n","                            Find out more\n","                            \n","\n","\n","\n"," Panasonic’s energy strategy director Masaya Aiba and Shigeki Yasuda, senior engineer of the RE100 project, discuss the challenges of integrating three different energy systems into an ageing Cardiff facility and the role of hydrogen in the future of clean energy.  Shigeki Yasuda (SY): The main challenge was adapting our system to comply with the UK’s safety standards, especially when treating high-pressure hydrogen. This was completely new to us, very different from what we do in Japan. So, we made sure to work with local experts and get their advice, in addition to using our insights from the project in Japan. We realised how important it is to understand the different regulations in different countries.  SY: From a technical point, there is a cultural difference between Japan and Europe in the use of heat, and how to use hot water from pure hydrogen. In Japan, we usually use heat for domestic water, like for the shower. In Europe, heating demand is higher as heat is used for generating electricity, heating spaces and hot water. So, at this factory, to make sure we can use the heat from the hydrogen for heating the factory and hot water, we took different steps to verify the effectiveness of heat utilisation.  SY: In this proof of concept (POC), we asked for the heat demand of the factory, and then worked together with a local construction company on how to best utilise the heat. According to our simulation with them, we could reduce our power consumption by 50% by optimising both power and exhaust heat from the fuel cell.  Access the most comprehensive Company Profiles\n","            on the market, powered by GlobalData.

In total, we can achieve up to 104% efficiency because we try to utilise the heat as much as possible.  SY: We worked closely with a UK-based hydrogen company, Protium, for this project, to verify the purity of hydrogen. We need to take samples from time to time, and we try to understand how to adopt the hydrogen purity from a technical side. Of course, we are working to improve our robustness for hydrogen purity. This is a target objective of our POC.  Masaya Aiba (MA): The biggest challenge was space. New buildings can usually guarantee enough space to install the system – for example, electricity generators, such as turbines – which can require a lot of space. But in the case of retrofitting, it is a bit difficult to find enough room. However, our solution was putting importance on the flexibility of design and installation. We have small fuel cell units, and we can use them individually for a few megawatts (MW) or combine the units to increase the generating capacity to up to 100 kilowatts (kW). The compact, scalable design enables us to flexibly install depending on the space available. Because units are very small, we were able to easily design the installation space, distributing the units’ placements in the building. MA: We are planning to put importance on our hydrogen business towards 2030, or even 2040. We have been doing business in solar panels and batteries as well and will continue doing so, but for the time being, we will focus the portfolio on hydrogen, specifically to broaden our hydrogen business in Europe and Japan. MA: In the business of renewable energy in the past, we felt that renewable generation of electricity is dependent on the weather, which fluctuates a lot and frequently.

Ohio groups question purpose of ‘green’ nuclear bill\n","Link: https://energynews.us/2024/12/20/a-symbolic-gesture-or-trojan-horse-ohio-groups-question-purpose-of-green-nuclear-bill/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Ohio environmental advocates are questioning the intent of a pending state law that would add nuclear power to the state’s legal definition of “green” energy. House Bill 308’s sponsors say the legislation is meant to signal that Ohio is open for business when it comes to nuclear power research and development, but critics warn the language could have broader implications in the future. “Legislators don’t just put something into the code unless it has meaning and purpose and value,” said Megan Hunter, an attorney with Earthjustice, one of several environmental groups challenging a similar 2022 state law that classified natural gas as a “green” energy source. “Why would you do this if it has no impact or meaning or effect?” Critics fear the language could be used to greenwash power plants or divert public funding from renewable energy projects, though the bill’s sponsors deny that motive. “It doesn’t promise any incentives or anything beyond simply placing nuclear under the category of green energy in the Ohio Revised Code,” said state Rep. Sean Brennan, a Democrat from Parma who co-sponsored the nuclear legislation with Republican state Rep. Dick Stein of Norwalk.  Every morning, thousands of energy professionals turn to our newsletters for the day’s most important news. Sign up for free to get the latest delivered straight to your inbox. The General Assembly passed the nuclear legislation on Dec. 11. As of Thursday it was awaiting Gov. Mike DeWine’s signature. Brennan said the question of why the language should be in a law instead of just a resolution didn’t come up in discussions with Stein, who initially asked him to cosponsor the bill. Stein said the legislation is “about sending a signal to the market that Ohio wants to be a partner and won’t be an impediment,” in contrast to other states that don’t want nuclear energy. He said he hopes it will help attract jobs and federal funding, building on last year’s creation of a state nuclear development authority. Stein would not speculate on follow-up steps lawmakers might take, saying his term in the House of Representatives ends this month. Ohio does not currently have state incentives or policy preferences for “green” energy. The state’s renewable energy standard essentially ended in 2019 as a result of House Bill 6, the coal and nuclear bailout law at the heart of the state’s ongoing corruption scandal. Opponents testifying against the current legislation, though, said they worry the definition will be used to water down future clean energy policies.  “HB 308 will enable the manipulation of public funds into private, corporate hands,” said Pat Marida, a coordinator for the Ohio Nuclear-Free Network, in her December 13 testimony. Also, she said, “there is nothing ‘green’ about nuclear power,” referring to radioactive waste, which continues to be stored at power plant sites. Future state programs might offer funding or other advantages for projects that meet the state’s definition of “green” energy, for example. And even if the definition doesn’t open doors to new government funding, it could provide cover to private companies that want to count gas and nuclear energy toward their climate or clean energy targets, another advocate warned. “Insidiously, it does potentially become important,” said Nathan Alley, conservation manager for the Sierra Club of Ohio. Many companies have adopted clean energy goals, he noted. “This might telegraph to them that they could invest in nuclear energy and achieve the same climate and/or energy goals as if they invest in solar or wind.” Ohio lawmakers aren’t the only ones who want to define natural gas and nuclear power as “green energy.” Model legislation finalized by the American Legislative Exchange Council this fall does the same thing. ALEC is a Koch-linked group that has long opposed renewable energy and actions to address climate change. ALEC’s model bill would have its definition “apply to all programs in the state that fund any ‘green energy’ or ‘clean energy’ initiatives.” Another model ALEC bill would define nuclear energy as “clean energy” and put it on a par with renewable energy. A coalition of environmental groups is currently challenging House Bill 507, Ohio’s 2022 law that labeled natural gas as “green energy,” arguing in court that the way in which it was passed violated the state constitution. The groups say last-minute amendments violated provisions that require bills to deal with a single subject – the initial two-page bill dealt with chickens – and call for at least three hearings in each house of the General Assembly where lawmakers can hear testimony from supporters and opponents. That lawsuit has been briefed and is currently awaiting a decision from Judge Kimberly Cocroft at the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. HB 308 should not affect that case, said Hunter and Alley. As with HB 507, though, lawmakers added last-minute amendments to HB 308.

The five project teams advancing to the next phase of the DOE project were among a cohort of 11 projects participating in the initial phase of the program, where coalitions selected project sites, assessed geothermal resource and permitting needs, conducted feasibility analysis and local engagement, and identified workforce and training needs. The selected projects’ range of sizes, technologies, and innovations will provide potential templates for other communities considering implementing geothermal systems.  Three of the five projects are located in urban or suburban areas; two are in rural communities. The other three recipients are the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan; the University of Oklahoma, for a project in the town of Shawnee; and GTI Energy, for a project in Hinesburg, Vermont.  Blacks in Green, located in West Woodlawn, a predominantly Black community on Chicago’s South Side, serves as the lead for a coalition which was awarded $9.9 million for its Sustainable Chicago Geothermal pilot. Other coalition partners are the City of Chicago, University of Illinois, The Accelerate Group, Citizens Utility Board, Climate Jobs Illinois, dbHMS, GeoExchange, and Illinois AFL-CIO. Every morning, thousands of energy professionals turn to our newsletters for the day’s most important news. Sign up for free to get the latest delivered straight to your inbox. The pilot, also located in West Woodlawn, utilizes alleys to circumvent the need for vast open plots for subterranean loop fields that form the heart of a geothermal array. Locating the bulk of geothermal loop lines in alleyways also sidesteps the underground congestion of existing utility infrastructure typically located underneath city streets. It’s among an assortment of elements in the Sustainable Square Mile approach that advances BIG’s vision for energy justice through clean energy and microgrid/VPP systems owned and managed by the community, said Naomi Davis, BIG’s founder and CEO. “BIG launched in 2007 with a goal of increasing household income and community resilience against the harms of climate crisis at neighborhood scale using the new green economy — so we’re grateful for this chance to make it manifest,” Davis said in a news release.  Along with installation of the needed infrastructure within the multiblock footprint, year two of the West Woodlawn project will focus on community outreach and job programs. Once construction is complete, the geothermal system will provide heating and cooling, not to mention lower utility bills, for potentially more than 200 households.  “The Sustainable Chicago Geothermal project will be a transformational investment in the West Woodlawn community. The effort to eliminate harmful emissions from homes and businesses, while lowering energy burden, has proven to be a community-wide challenge, and requires a community-wide solution,” said Andrew Barbeau, president of The Accelerate Group and principal investigator of the Blacks in Green project, in a news release.  The need to reconstruct the alleyways after installation of the geothermal array also presents the opportunity to replace asphalt or concrete with permeable pavers. This would work to promote climate resiliency through mitigation of urban flooding, a persistent occurrence in many of Chicago’s South and West Side communities, said Nuri Madina, the director of Sustainable Square Mile, who serves as point person for the pilot. “All of our programs are designed to create multiple benefits,” Madina told the Energy News Network in September. Home Energy Efficiency Team, commonly referred to by the acronym HEET, in partnership with Eversource Energy; the city of Framingham, Massachusetts; and engineering consultant Salas O’Brien; was awarded $7.8 million toward construction of a utility-based,community-scale geothermal system. “We are honored to receive this funding from the DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Office as part of the Community Geothermal Heating and Cooling initiative, and to show how geothermal energy networks can be interconnected to increase efficiency, build resilience, and decarbonize at the scale and speed we need to achieve our climate goals,” said Zeyneb Magavi, executive director for HEET, in a news release. The proposed plans by HEET and its partners would connect to the first Framingham geothermal network, which was commissioned earlier this year.

It’s the headquarters for the Center for Energy Education, the nonprofit Lowe has run since 2016 that works to maximize the benefits of large solar farms in rural America — one community, one school child, and one worker at a time.  Lowe, who grew up about five miles from where she now works, had graduated from Greensboro’s North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University but worked across the country, from California to Washington, D.C.  When she returned to this rural county of less than 50,000 near the Virginia border, formerly a hub of farming and textiles, she said she didn’t see a lot of change.   Every morning, thousands of energy professionals turn to our newsletters for the day’s most important news. Sign up for free to get the latest delivered straight to your inbox. “The jobs were the same,” she said. “I didn’t see people making the connection between solar energy and what’s happening with the climate and the impact on rural communities, and I just wanted to try and help from that angle.”  The Center conducts educational programs for children of all ages, who come in by the busload from surrounding schools both public and private. It holds a Solar Fest every year to celebrate clean energy with community leaders, drawing hundreds. Through collaborations with local educational institutions like community colleges, the center has also helped to train a new workforce in jobs that pay roughly twice what workers are earning at the fast-food chains off Interstate 95.  “We have trained more people than most other people around here to become solar installers,” Lowe said. “We want them to be first in line for our jobs.” And there’s outreach to solar companies themselves in North Carolina as well as Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana, where the Center also has offices. The goal is to help them become better community partners. Geenex, the Charlotte-based developer who built the solar farm at the airport and over a dozen others in the vicinity, is still involved in the Center, and the company’s chairman also chairs the nonprofit’s board.   But Lowe and other staff at the organization say not every solar developer is committed — at least at first — to working with community leaders in Eastern North Carolina.  “Geenex is a very good partner,” said Reginald Bynum, the Center’s community outreach manager. “They’re a good player. But there are only a few of them. Other companies will say, ‘This is your ordinance? Great. This is all I have to do.’”  Some county ordinances, like that in Halifax, need to be updated, Bynum said. Many still call for a 75-foot buffer between the rows of solar panels and neighboring properties. That figure is “so 2018,” said Bynum. It should be doubled, he said.  Most solar farms are also built on private land — often bits of farmland that can help cotton growers and other farmers guarantee income. But developers usually obtain the leases first, before airing the project in public.  “That’s the backwards process of solar,” Bynum said. “They’re talking to landowners and securing that land, and then they’re coming to commissioners.”  What’s more, simply following ordinances isn’t enough, Bynum says. What’s needed is for solar developers to work with local residents to develop community benefits agreements — documents that memorialize pluses to the area, from minimizing construction impacts to providing jobs.  “It’s a 30-year commitment to the community,” he said, “because your farm’s going to be here 30 years. They’re asking for that, and they deserve that.”  Critically, say Bynum and other advocates, solar developers need to work with community leaders to provide benefits beyond tax revenue — an undeniable good, but one that isn’t “seen” by anyone except county bookkeepers. And though a recent study from the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association shows that solar farms today take up a fraction of a percent of the state’s farmland, the figure is a full 1% in Halifax County, and on pace to triple in the coming years, according to the Center’s research.  “From rural citizens’ standpoint, that’s a lot,” Bynum said. “You have to really understand what they’re seeing.”  Part of what they’re seeing is the result of a simple fact: solar farms aren’t just growing more abundant in parts of rural America. They’re also much larger. In North Carolina up until 2016, the average utility-scale solar development was 5.8 megawatts covering 35 acres of land, per the Sustainable Energy Association.

Since then, state lawmakers passed a new law requiring state agencies and boards, including the state port authority, to consider the impact of greenhouse gas emissions in their decisions.  The measure does not directly prohibit the Massachusetts Port Authority from proceeding with projects such as the Hanscom plan, but it does leave the agency vulnerable to legal action should it forge ahead without being able to show it weighed the likely greenhouse gas emissions against the benefits of the plan.  Every morning, thousands of energy professionals turn to our newsletters for the day’s most important news. Sign up for free to get the latest delivered straight to your inbox. The expansion plan started with Massport, which oversees operations at Hanscom as well as Boston’s Logan International Airport and Worcester Regional Airport. In 2021, the agency released a request for proposals to develop “much-needed hangars” at the airport, said Massport spokesperson Jennifer Mehigan. A plan submitted by North Airfield Ventures and Runway Realty Ventures won the bid.  The proposed facilities would be built on 47 acres of land, some of which is already owned by the developers and some of which would be leased to them by Massport. The project comprises 17 new hangars, the rehabilitation of a historic Navy hangar on the site, and fuel storage facilities.  Planners argue the development would be environmentally beneficial, because the structures would be designed for net-zero energy use and built to LEED Gold standards, and buildings and equipment would be electrified whenever possible. They also claim the additional capacity would help cut down on emissions from so-called “ferry flights,” in which a plane hangared elsewhere flies to Hanscom to pick up passengers and then returns to its home airport at the end of the trip.  Opponents, however, argue that more hangars will inevitably mean more flights. These flights, they say, are likely to be private jet travel to luxury locations, generating emissions for the benefit of just a privileged few. One report, by Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Policy Studies, found that 31,600 private flights departed Hanscom during an 18-month period in 2022 and 2023, and that roughly half of those were bound for high-end vacation destinations like the Bahamas, Palm Beach, and Nantucket. “It’s very well known that private jets are the most polluting form of transportation per passenger ever devised,” Chatfield said. “It is on a scale that is really hard to imagine.” State environmental regulators are also skeptical. The state response to the developers’ first environmental impact report, referred to the “fanciful nature of the proponents’ ‘ferry flight theory,’” pointing to a study that found only 132 ferry flights actually occurred at Hanscom rather than the 3,500 developers claimed. Regulators also suggested new hangars at Hanscom were unlikely to attract planes to relocate, and therefore would not reduce what ferry flights do occur. The developers can resubmit their environmental impact report, addressing the state’s concerns. One of the founders of North Airfield Ventures said the company declines to comment on its plans at this time.  In the months since the state’s order was released, legislators created another obstacle for the project.  As Massachusetts attempts to reach its goal of net-zero carbon emissions, an ongoing mundane-yet-important challenge has been the fact that some crucial state agencies and boards have lacked the authority to factor climate impacts in their decisions. These bodies were founded well before the climate crisis became such a pressing public policy question, and thus their rules never required or authorized them to consider greenhouse gas emissions or other climate impacts in their decision-making.  In recent years, attempts have been made to integrate climate change mitigation into more statewide policies and processes. A climate law enacted in 2021 requires the administration to set greenhouse gas reduction goals to be realized by the state’s three-year energy efficiency plans, which were initially inten\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Commentary: Ohio should replicate Pennsylvania’s success cutting methane pollution\n","Link: https://energynews.us/2024/12/17/commentary-ohio-should-replicate-pennsylvanias-success-cutting-methane-pollution/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","The following commentary was written by Jesse Velazquez, Climate Justice Manager at the Ohio Environmental Council. See our commentary guidelines for more information. In his victory speech, President-elect Donald Trump promised to further boost “liquid gold,” also known as oil and gas. Today, oil and gas production is at record highs and continues to grow. As the industry expands, so do concerns about methane pollution. The primary component of natural gas is methane, a potent greenhouse gas that warms the planet more than 80 times as much as carbon dioxide over 20 years. It’s also a significant contributor to smog and public health issues like asthma and respiratory disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities. Yet, efforts to reduce methane emissions present a rare win-win opportunity: they not only curb pollution but also create jobs and foster innovation. Take Pennsylvania, one of the largest natural gas producers, for example. By adopting innovative methane mitigation strategies, the state is reducing harmful emissions from oil and gas operations while creating jobs and fostering a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. This balanced approach showcases how economic growth and environmental responsibility can go hand in hand, offering a model that Ohio should replicate. Every morning, thousands of energy professionals turn to our newsletters for the day’s most important news. Sign up for free to get the latest delivered straight to your inbox. According to the 2024 State of the Methane Mitigation Industry Report, developing and implementing technologies to cut methane pollution would create jobs ranging from manufacturing leak-detection equipment to technicians skilled in repairing faulty infrastructure. Pennsylvania saw a 22.2% growth in methane mitigation companies over the last three years. Since 2014, the industry has expanded by 65% with the state now hosting 33 methane mitigation companies. In fact, Pennsylvania is now home to 8.5% of the total employee locations in this sector nationwide. These good-paying, family-sustaining jobs bolster local economies while addressing critical environmental challenges. And the opportunity for Ohio is immense. The benefits extend far beyond jobs. Reducing methane emissions means less wasted energy. Nationally, oil and gas companies emit enough methane waste annually that could be utilized to meet the energy needs of millions of homes. Capturing the lost gases would translate directly into increased efficiency and cost savings. For a state like Ohio, with its large-scale oil and gas operations, this represents a tangible economic benefit. This isn’t just about economic gains. Methane mitigation is also a crucial climate strategy. The U.S. EPA’s Section 111 Methane Rule, finalized a year ago, set robust federal standards to limit methane emissions from oil and gas operations. While essential, this rule relies heavily on state-level implementation to achieve its full potential. States like Ohio have a chance to lead by adopting and building on these standards, aligning economic growth with environmental stewardship. And we know clean air and economic growth are priorities that transcend party lines, as evidenced by the broad coalition of businesses, environmental advocates, and community leaders rallying behind these initiatives. Ohio is at a crossroads. We can continue business as usual, or we can follow Pennsylvania’s lead, investing in proven technologies and practices that cut emissions, prevent waste, protect public health, and drive economic growth. By prioritizing methane mitigation, the state can chart a path that aligns with both the nation’s energy ambitions and the pressing need for climate action. This is not just a moral imperative but an economic one that promises cleaner air, healthier communities, and a thriving workforce for generations to come.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Energy-Storage.news - Found 10 articles.\n","\n","Title: Bankability, procurement, patents and optimisation: Energy-Storage.news Guest Blog picks from 2024\n","Link: https://www.energy-storage.news/bankability-procurement-patents-and-optimisation-energy-storage-news-guest-blog-picks-from-2024/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","As the year draws to a close, we look back at some of the brilliant Guest Blog contributions published on Energy-Storage.news in the last 12 months.

Do higher risks mean higher returns for battery storage investors? 24 January 2024 As the energy storage market matures, a discernible trend suggests increasing investor comfort with associated risks. While tolling arrangements and floor prices act to provide a predictable income, the merchant model, where revenues are tied to market prices, introduces an element of risk, but also the potential for higher returns. In this webinar with GridBeyond, we explored:  Lessons in BESS manufacturing quality, learned from 30GWh+ of factory inspections 31 January 2024 In the past six years, CEA has performed factory quality audits on over 30GWh of BESS projects, employing a multi-faceted approach to target these issues. The team’s findings at each manufacturing stage highlight common quality issues that may cause commissioning delays, excessive degradation and even thermal events and fires. In this webinar, CEA’s BESS experts share:  How to generate profit from battery storage beyond ancillary services 4 April 2024 While the business case for battery energy storage system (BESS) technology often begins with ancillary services, as markets evolve, other applications will become more and more important in the BESS asset revenue stack. In this webinar, experts discuss the evolution of the revenue stack for batteries in Europe. Our speakers are directly involved in building a business case and optimising income on the market, maximising revenues for energy storage assets. Taking part are Clean Horizon, an energy storage consultancy that helps build an optimal business case for storage, applying its simulation tool COSMOS, and YUSO, which provides route-to-market and energy optimisation services to BESS assets, operating an energy platform to provide market access.  Insurance innovations that unlock the potential of battery storage systems 15 May 2024 The rapid growth of energy storage has created challenges for insurers seeking to identify appropriate risks posed by a new and complex asset class. For owners and operators, this can mean grappling with high premiums that do not always reflect the unique characteristics of their projects. In this webinar with battery data analytics specialists ACCURE Battery Intelligence, we bring together experts from across the insurance and energy storage landscape to unravel and make sense of the complexities of insuring BESS and reveal how insurance policies can be optimised with a data-driven approach.  The energy storage supply landscape: a guide to BESS procurement 3 September 2024 Experts from Clean Energy Associates discuss how to approach the constantly evolving question of BESS procurement. The dynamics which determine the pricing, competition and supply chain for batteries and battery energy storage system (BESS) technologies are complex and ever-changing, and the past 12 months has perhaps been the most frenzied yet. That makes it a great time to hear from CEA on how to approach the topic of procuring BESS today.  Battery storage trading strategies for ERCOT and CAISO market success 6 November 2024 As renewable energy and energy storage continue to transform power grids across the USA, it’s crucial for utility-scale battery storage asset owners to understand the changes in market dynamics and changes in trading strategies that will keep providing their target revenues.

The industry has gone from strength to strength this year, with deployments continuing to break records and new markets opening up at scale all over the world. See our previous ‘biggest ‘ roundup pieces for 2023 (here) and 2022 (here).  Click the sub-heading to go to the article. The full completion and commercial operation of the Edwards & Sanborn project in California was announced in January 2024. The project in Kern County pairs 875MWdc of solar PV and 3,287MWh of battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity, the world’s largest.  An earlier portion of the project came online in 2021, comprising about half of the capacity, but even the additional 1,600MWh on which commercial operations were announced this year would make it the largest we’ve reported on.  The largest BESS project formally revealed by a company that we’ve reported on is Netherlands-based developer Giga Storage’s 2.4GWh ‘Green Turtle’ project, also announced in January. Since then, the project has increased in size to 2.8GWh, and is scheduled to come online in 2028.  Others have been revealed of a similar size, but none larger than 2.8GWh that we are aware of. Energy-Storage.news has reported on larger projects as part of Premium-access exclusive pieces, based on local permitting and development filings in the US, including 4GWh ones from Brookfield in Oregon and Stellar Renewable Power in Arizona.  Rongke Power’s 175MW/700MWh vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) project in China, completed in late 2024, covers two categories in one go – ‘biggest non-lithium/non-pumped hydro project commissioned’ and ‘biggest non-lithium BESS commissioned’, dwarfing both of last year’s picks for each (which were under 20MWh each). Honourable mentions here include the largest sodium-ion BESS at 100MW/200MWh and the first large-scale project using Energy Vault’s gravity energy storage technology, at 25MW/100MWh, both commissioned in China this year. Note: If you’re wondering why we haven’t included a pick for ‘Biggest financing package for energy storage’ and ‘Biggest offtake agreement between cell supplier and system integrator’, here’s why. There were too many financings to pick through, many of which were for solar and storage portfolios. And there were many fewer major cell-system integrator offtake deals announced, perhaps pointing to a maturing industry.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Energy-Storage.news’ most-read news stories of 2024\n","Link: https://www.energy-storage.news/energy-storage-news-most-read-news-stories-of-2024/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","As we welcome the end of another exciting, if sometimes challenging year, here are the most-read news stories on Energy-Storage.news for 2024. One of the obvious takeaways of this list is that some very big lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery storage projects are being built and brought online. That trend is set to continue into 2025 with many more gigawatt-hour scale projects in development or construction, and not just in the more mature markets. It’s interesting too, that the two biggest battery storage projects on this list, Gemini in Nevada and Edwards & Sanborn in California, are both solar-plus-storage hybrid resources.  In the lithium-ion space, our reporting and subsequent deep dives into the higher energy density solutions offered by CATL and a wealth of other manufacturers and system integrators drew a lot of attention. Again, we expect this to continue, although there are financial, logistical and technical limits to how far the envelope can be pushed on energy density, at least in the immediate future. We have also seen enormous growth in interest from our readers in non-lithium energy storage solutions, with sodium-ion (Na-ion) particularly starting to make waves. Yet the bankruptcy of flow battery maker Redflow and the cancelling of the world’s biggest pumped hydro project in Queensland, Australia, show that it can be challenging to channel private investment and political will for high Capex technologies.    Perhaps distributed energy technologies like vehicle-to-grid (V2G) are a hint of where some of the interest in battery technology lies. At the other end of the scale, our most-read story of 2024 tells the tale of what happened when interconnectors tripped, and large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) helped save the UK grid from blackouts. With a minor nod of cultural reference to the classic comedy rock music movie ‘This is Spinal Tap’, this list goes to 11. 11. ‘US’ largest’ solar-plus-storage project, Gemini, comes online in Nevada 19 July 2024 Project owners Quinbrook and Primergy brought their 1.4GWh Gemini solar-plus-storage project in Nevada online, claimed to be the largest such project in the US. Gemini, in Nevada’s Clark County, pairs 690MWac/966MWdc of solar PV with a 380MW/1,400MWh battery energy storage system (BESS), developed and built by investor Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners and independent power producer (IPP) Primergy Solar. 10. LFP price falls ‘make first life batteries more attractive’ than second life ones, firm says 11 January 2024 The increasing cost-competitiveness of LFP battery cells has made first life batteries more attractive than second life ones, Finland-based BESS solutions firm Cactos told Energy-Storage.news after a €26 million (US$28.5 million) fundraise. When the firm raised €2.5 million back in November 2022, it presented itself as primarily repurposing used batteries from Tesla electric vehicles (EVs) into stationary BESS, otherwise known as second life energy storage. However, founder and CEO Oskari Jaakkola told Energy-Storage.news that falls in the prices of new lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries since then have changed this. 9. CATL unveils ‘five-year zero degradation’ BESS with 6.25MWh per container 15 April 2024 Lithium-ion battery manufacturer CATL launched its latest grid-scale BESS product, with 6.25MWh storage capacity per 20-foot container and the company claiming it will experience zero degradation over the first five years of operation. The China-headquartered company announced the ‘Tener’ battery energy storage system (BESS) solution with several claims of industry-leading technical specifications. The foremost among them is that the lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries inside will not suffer any degradation over the first five years. 8. Non-lithium alternatives: Reliance completes sodium-ion acquisition, Amazon tries ‘membrane-free’ flow battery 31 October 2024 India’s Reliance Industries completed the takeover of sodium-ion (Na-ion) battery company Faradion, while Amazon said it will trial a novel flow battery technology in this double-hit of non-lithium battery technology news. UK startup Faradion had developed IP around several aspects of Na-ion technology, and Reliance Industries – one of India’s major multinational conglomerates – acquired a majority stake in the company at the end of 2021 for around US$135 million before moving its shareholding to 100% at the end of October. Online retail giant Amazon agreed to trial a novel flow battery technology made by a Swiss startup called Unbound Potential. In other flow batteries, a membrane is used to separate the electrolytes, whereas ion exchange in the Swiss startup’s battery is controlled by non-miscible electrolytes. The company claims this makes the battery more durable and reduces the cost and complexity of manufacture. 7.

The president-elect has selected oil industry executive Chris Wright to replace Jennifer Granholm as the US energy secretary. Wright has no political experience and famously said there is no climate crisis or an energy transition. This would come as a surprise to the DOE and its Loan Programs Office (LPO), which has announced over US$70 billion in conditional commitment and closed loans for projects supporting innovative energy and supply chain technology for clean energy, financing for the deployment of clean energy technologies, and reinvestment in existing energy infrastructure. That said, despite those perhaps worrying signs, the DOE’s current programme to guide the accelerated ‘development, commercialisation, and utilisation of next-generation energy storage technologies,’ the Energy Storage Grand Challenge roadmap, was released during the tail-end of the previous Trump presidency. Some sources Energy-Storage.news has spoken to have said that they expect energy storage to be a continued focus of political support, not least of all because it’s good business and many investments in battery manufacturing in particular are in traditionally Republican states.  Earlier this month, Energy-Storage.news reported on the US$56.02 billion in conditional commitments and closed loans done by the DOE’s LPO. Since then, conditional commitments have been announced for a thermal energy startup, as well as utilities in California, Wisconsin and Puerto Rico, totalling over US$73 billion. The DOE’s 2024 SRM builds on the Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) 2020 roadmap, outlining actions for what the SRM calls a strategic, beneficial and timely storage deployment. The SRM cites the underlying motivation for investment in energy storage as ensuring “that the American people will have the resources needed, when needed.” The DOE will use three strategic objectives to guide its storage activities: “1. To facilitate safe, beneficial, and timely deployment of energy storage technologies and accelerate the development of new technologies that address current and emerging consumer needs. 2. To empower decision-makers by providing unbiased and fact-based information and analysis to enhance their energy storage-related investments, policies, and goals. 3. To leverage DOE’s global leadership in the energy storage community and accelerate the path from innovation to commercialisation that benefits all Americans by effective and durable engagement throughout the innovation ecosystem.” The SRM continues, laying out eight strategies to support these objectives: “1. Make long-term investments in fundamental and responsible energy storage technology research. 2. Target strategic, high-impact use cases for energy storage technologies. 3. Improve energy storage implementation cost assessments. 4. Inform the value proposition through development of valuation assessments and compensation mechanisms. 5. Enhance safety and reliability of energy storage technologies. 6. Advance equitable access to energy storage technologies to meet existing and emerging community needs. 7. Strengthen and enable reliable, resilient, affordable, diverse, sustainable, and secure domestic energy storage supply chains, including critical minerals and materials and a circular economy, that helps expand American manufacturing and jobs. 8. Collaborate across DOE programs, mission areas, and external to DOE.” These strategies are a part of what the DOE calls “the ecosystem around energy storage.” The provided figure illustrates this “ecosystem.” The LPO director, Jigar Shah, spoke previously on the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, sparking a more “aggressive” approach to climate change from the US. Wright’s appointment is not confirmed, but it would almost certainly lead to changes in activity from the LPO. While the future of the DOE’s LPO remains uncertain, the SRM shows that the department is placing a heavy focus on energy storage research and innovation and providing facts about the technology that could inform its future in the energy market. The DOE is asking for comment from stakeholders to inform its energy storage SRM through a formal Notice of Availability (NOA).\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: South Africa: BESIPPPP Window 2 winners revealed\n","Link: https://www.energy-storage.news/south-africa-besipppp-window-2-winners-revealed/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","The Department of Electricity and Energy of South Africa has announced the successful bidders for the second round of its Battery Energy Storage Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (BESIPPPP).  Eight preferred bidders have been selected, totalling 615MW of battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity, which will be built at various substations belonging to grid operator Eskom following financial close.  The projects are spread across North West, Free State and Gauteng states and will provide power, energy and ancillary services to Eskom under 15-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) once online. Eskom has struggled to prevent widespread and frequent blackouts and load shedding, and BESS will help mitigate the risk of this. All eight have power capacities of 77MW, and the winning developers were France-headquartered utility and independent power producer (IPP) EDF, Dubai-based IPP AMEA Power, and local developer and IPP Mulilo.  However, Mulilo and EDF worked together as part of a consortium for winning projects in BESIPPPP Window 1, and they may be doing the same for this Window (EDF just hired Envision to supply the BESS for those projects). Five of Window 2’s projects are Mulilo’s, with two for AMEA Power and one for EDF.  See a table from the Department of Electricity and Energy below, including capital cost recovery charge rates (CCR) and evaluation price.  The government department also revealed a list of 33 bidders for Window 3 of BESIPPPP last month, which included IPPS Globeleq and TotalEnergies. South Africa is also supporting the deployment of large-scale energy storage via similar schemes for hybrid renewables and storage projects, including the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) and Risk Mitigation IPP Procurement Programme.  A REIPPPP-winning solar and 1.14GWh BESS project from IPP Scatec was inaugurated earlier this year, with electricity minister Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopa calling South Africa a ‘trailblazer’ for solar and battery storage. Energy-Storage.news has also reported today that AMEA Power has selected Trina to supply the BESS for a project in Egypt.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: AMEA Power picks Trinasolar to supply BESS for Africa’s largest single-site solar PV plant\n","Link: https://www.energy-storage.news/amea-power-picks-trinasolar-to-supply-bess-for-africas-largest-single-site-solar-pv-plant/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Developer AMEA Power will collaborate with Trinasolar and Energy China ZTPC to install battery storage at a 500MW solar PV plant in Egypt, Africa. Trinasolar announced the partnership yesterday (23 December), with the China-headquartered vertically integrated solar PV manufacturer set to provide the 300MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) at AMEA Power’s Abydos Solar Power Plant. Dubai-based AMEA Power has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) for Abydos in the southern city of Aswan with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company.    A press release claimed Abydos to be Egypt’s largest single-site solar PV plant. Norwegian developer Scatec brought a project in Kenhardt, South Africa, into operation earlier this year. That project features 540MW of solar generation capacity along with 225MW/1,140MWh of battery storage, but it is spread across three sites. The Abydos PV project was recently inaugurated with a ceremony attended by dignitaries, including Egypt’s prime minister, Dr. Mostafa Madbouly, and its minister of electricity and renewable energy, Dr. Mahmoud Esmat. Trinasolar will supply its Elementa 2 containerised battery storage solution to the project’s expansion phase. Elementa 2 uses lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells and has 5MWh storage capacity per 20-foot standardised enclosure.   The PV manufacturer launched its BESS system integrator subsidiary Trina Storage in 2021 and uses in-house manufactured LFP cells in its projects (Premium access). The project for AMEA Power marks Trinasolar’s first energy storage project in the Middle East and Africa region. To date, Trina Storage has delivered several gigawatt-hours of BESS projects in China and the UK. It recently inaugurated its first projects in the US and won contracts in European countries, including Germany and Italy. Its parent company has also turned developer of gigawatt-hour-scale battery projects in Australia, recently lodging planning applications for a 2.6GWh BESS project in Western Australia and another 1GWh project in Victoria. Meanwhile, partner Energy China ZTPC is a subsidiary of Energy China Construction Group, a Chinese state-owned enterprise specialised in engineering and construction of fossil fuel and nuclear thermal power plants, renewable energy, power plant maintenance and construction, and power grids.

Connecticut’s public utility and energy policy regulator has selected 518MW of solar PV and a 200MW energy storage project through competitive solicitations. The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) announced last week (20 December) that three large-scale solar PV projects and one standalone battery energy storage system (BESS) project were successful in reverse auctions for zero-carbon energy resources and storage. DEEP held three requests for proposals (RFPs) launched from October 2023 to March 2024. They included a separate RFP through which 2,878MW of offshore wind projects were selected, while the state agency received more than 50 project submissions from 27 developers for the renewables and storage solicitations.   The BESS project, called Naugatuck Avenue, was submitted by developer Jupiter Power and is the first to be awarded by the state. The three solar PV projects comprise D.E. Shaw Renewables Investments’ (DESRI’s) 200MW Solar Nursery plant, the 250MW Freedom Pine Solar, also from DESRI, and the 68MW Crooked Trail Solar project from developer Verogy.   Naugatuck Avenue and Solar Nursery will be located within Connecticut, while Crooked Trail and Freedom Pine Solar are in Maine. The BESS project will contribute towards Connecticut’s 1,000MW by 2030 energy storage policy goal. DEEP estimated that the four clean energy projects between them will save ratepayers approximately US$424 million in energy supply costs over 20 years of operation. The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) has invited utility Portland General Electric (PGE) to apply for recovery of the costs of investing in a large-scale BESS facility. The state regulator issued a decision last week (20 December) in a PGE rate review request, approving the utility’s application to increase rates by 5.5% for residential customers and 7.7% for non-residential from the beginning of 2025. The rate hike will support investments and upgrades in transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure and low-carbon technologies, including hardening the grid from the impacts of extreme weather events and deploying a battery storage system.   PGE is seeking to raise its revenues by around US$98 million, around 54% of the cost of the utility’s open brief filing of US$182 million. The PUC approved a 50% debt and 50% equity capital structure with return on equity (ROE) of 9.34%. PGE will now evaluate the impact of the order on its planned investments in operations and maintenance (O&M), fleet electrification and Clearwater Wind Energy Center, a 750MW wind power plant in development by NextEra Energy Resources. Meanwhile, the PUC made its invitation to the utility to file a separate revenue recovery request for its proposed investment in Seaside Grid, a 200MW/800MWh battery storage project. Developer Eolian submitted the Seaside project to PGE’s 2021 all-source RFP, where the utility sought up to 375MW of ‘non-emitting dispatchable capacity’—such as battery storage—alongside 500MW of renewable energy. As reported by Energy-Storage.news in May 2023, PGE selected Seaside Grid through the procurement. PGE will co-develop the project with Eolian and own it. At the time of the selection being announced, the estimated total cost of the Seaside project was US$360 million, minus the cost of construction. Another project of the same output and capacity, Troutdale Grid, was also selected from the RFP, originally developed by Eolian and sold to NextEra Energy Resources, but rather than taking an ownership stake, PGE intends to contract with the developer for its capacity over a 20-year term. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has made a US$2.6 million grant award to flow battery startup Quino Energy for a demonstration project. The DOE’s Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technology Office (AMMTO) made the award via its programme Platform Technologies for Transformative Battery Manufacturing, Quino Energy said on Friday (20 December).  The project is set to demonstrate that Quino Energy’s organic electrolyte can be stored in carbon steel tanks used for the storage of oil and other fuels, potentially opening the path to repurposing fossil fuel industry infrastructure and constructing very large-scale long-duration energy storage (LDES) facilities at low cost. Quino Energy is commercialising its aqueous organic quinone redox flow battery (QRFB) technology that uses quinone-based electrolytes. The company claims that the organic electrolyte is less corrosive than vanadium pentoxide, which is more commonly used in the industry in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). Quino Energy will build two systems, one of 3kW/24kWh at lab scale and the other a commercial-scale field demonstrator of 200kW/2,000kWh. The systems are expected to go into operation by the end of 2026, and their performance will be \n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Eos and FlexGen partner for zinc-based BESS solutions\n","Link: https://www.energy-storage.news/eos-and-flexgen-partner-for-zinc-based-besss-olutions/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Eos Energy Enterprises has signed a joint development agreement (JDA) with FlexGen Power Systems to develop a fully integrated battery energy storage system (BESS) solution using Eos’ zinc batteries and Flexgen’s Energy Management System (EMS). FlexGen is the first major system integrator to announce a deal with a non-lithium-ion battery company that Energy-Storage.news is aware of. Eos and FlexGen plan to develop and commercialise a comprehensive, integrated US BESS solution. This solution will combine Eos’ Z3 zinc-based long duration energy storage (LDES) systems, a US inverter and transformer package, with FlexGen’s HybridOS EMS. This news follows the announcement that Eos received its first loan advance of US$68.3 million from the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) for the Mon Valley Works expansion project in Pennsylvania, US. As reported by Energy-Storage.news, the overall funding of US$303.5 million will support around 80% of the cost of Project American Made Zinc Energy (AMAZE), the company’s roadmap to creating 8GWh of annual production capacity from automated lines by 2027. Eos also secured a 400MWh standalone storage order with International Electric Power (IEP), which will be deployed at Haybarn Energy Reliability Centre, located at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in San Diego County, California. The government of California approved a US$42 million grant to IPP IEP for the project. Eos’ recent announcement confirms that the Haybarn Energy Reliability Centre will use the company’s Z3 Cubes, which the company claims are non-flammable and do not require cooling systems. This string of recent activity could mean good news for Eos, which saw a low-revenue Q3 this year compared to last year. The company attributed the news to supply chain issues related to the Z3 cube. Creating a reliable, domestic supply chain for the technology could prove profitable for the company. In April, FlexGen partnered with IPP Arclight and its subsidiary Infinigen Renewables to deploy a PV co-located 15MW BESS project in Puerto Rico. The BESS will utilise the system integrator’s HybridOS EMS. Energy-Storage.news covered the November 2023 announcement that FlexGen and BESS-focused cell manufacturer Hithium made a 25GWh two-way agreement for battery supply and EMS. Of this, 10GWh will be batteries sold by Hithium to FlexGen, making it one of the year’s biggest offtake agreements between cell suppliers and system integrators.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Power Info Today - Found 10 articles.\n","\n","Title: Is India on Right Path to a Sustainable Future\n","Link: https://www.powerinfotoday.com/news-press-releases/is-india-on-right-path-to-a-sustainable-future/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Over the years, India has made significant progress in the renewable energy sector to address climate change, which has emerged as a global concern and crisis. The set target, to attain net-zero emissions by 2070, is a national priority. Given the growing energy demand, it is not at all easy to pledge a decrease in emission intensity by 45%. However, sincere efforts to achieve a renewable energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030 would act as a powerful catalyst. India’s commitment in climate action was recently manifested in the Baku COP29 summit that revealed several complexities of global cooperation in climate change mitigation efforts. At COP29, the world’s focus centered on finalizing a finance agreement that could enable developing nations to undertake more ambitious climate actions. Developed nations have committed to increasing their climate finance contribution to $300 billion per year, a significant jump from the $100 billion promise made in 2009. Developing countries including India expressed their disappointment loud and clear. Their criticism was well-placed. The adoption process fails to meet the requirement, as envisaged in the Paris Agreement. It is agreed that by 2030, climate financing would require a minimum of $1.3 trillion annually to meet the global targets. The unequal distribution of duties between developed and developing nations was clearly reflected in the Baku Agreement. India leadership in climate action reflects in its realistic stance. It is widely admitted that significant investments in infrastructure, adaption strategies, and renewable energy are necessary to combat climate change. Challenges are many and climate change mitigation needs innovative solutions. Paying serious attention on making significant progress in renewable energy deployment has been paving the way as it serves as the foundation of its climate mitigation strategy. Solar energy is a standout success story, with India emerging as one of the top global markets for photovoltaic installations. To achieve its ambitious climate goals, India needs strong policy backing alongside financial and technological assistance. Programs like the National Solar Mission, Green Energy Corridors, and state-level incentives are crucial factors in the growth of renewable energy. Ambitious plans need innovation execution strategies and innovation. The National Hydrogen Mission reflects India’s ambition to diversify its clean energy sources. With plans to produce 5 million metric tons of green hydrogen annually by 2030, India is positioning itself as a global hub for this transformative fuel. Although these developments are promising, they need strong financial resources and technological assistance to expand further. In this situation, climate financing serves as a crucial support for developing nations working to achieve their climate goals while still fostering economic growth. Climate finance encompasses all funding intended to back actions for both mitigation and adaptation to tackle climate change. For countries such as India, it goes beyond just financial support; it also includes access to advanced technologies and initiatives aimed at building capacity. To realize its ambitious climate objectives, India requires robust policy support in addition to financial and technological resources. Initiatives such as the National Solar Mission, Green Energy Corridors, and incentives at the state level are key drivers of renewable energy expansion. Energy consultant firms play a crucial role in advancing India’s renewable energy transition by providing expertise in project planning, feasibility analysis, and risk management. Their tailored technical solutions ensure optimal efficiency and sustainability for renewable energy projects while addressing challenges like intermittency through advanced technologies and energy storage integration. The presence of numerous internationally recognised businesses actively providing engineering and technical consulting services for renewable energy projects in India is heartening. The success of these projects is greatly based on their proficiency in engineering design, performance optimisation, quality assurance, and independent assessment of both new and existing renewable energy facilities. In nutshell, not only India but the world’s path to a sustainable future is to harness its potential for renewable energy, promote equitable climate finance systems, and cultivate international collaborations to tackle the common issue of climate change.

The funding for the construction of a 300MW production plant using the high-temperature electrolysis technology SOEC (Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell) of the supplier of the world’s leading electrolysis technology can reaches up to EUR 36 million. The funding from the EU Innovation Fund is intended to enable thyssenkrupp nucera to further advance the industrialization of the highly efficient SOEC technology licensed from the Fraunhofer IKTS with the SOEC production plant to be constructed. The details will be clarified with the EU in a further step. The EU Innovation Fund supports particularly climate-friendly projects in the fields of energy efficiency and renewable energies, as well as research and innovation. “The EU is sending an important signal with its decision to support the construction of the SOEC production plant. Due to its high level of efficiency and great cost effectiveness, high-temperature electrolysis technology is a pioneering electrolysis technology to produce green hydrogen. It will enable companies to make an important contribution to decarbonization in the near future,” said Dr. Werner Ponikwar, CEO of thyssenkrupp nucera. Before the start of the 300 MW SOEC production plant, a pilot plant with 8 megawatts of installed capacity is scheduled to begin operating in the first half of 2025. In Arnstadt in Thuringia, the electrolyzer stacks, the most important core component of the high-temperature electrolyzer system, are to be manufactured in initially small quantities. “Scaling up the production of the SOEC stacks will enable thyssenkrupp nucera to achieve technology and market leadership in the pioneering SOEC technology,” says Professor Dr. Alexander Michaelis, Director of the Fraunhofer IKTS. The SOEC stack technology is based on oxygen-ion-conducting ceramic solid electrolyte, which is screen-printed with two electrodes and then connected to chromium-based interconnects. This chromium-based alloy is particularly suitable for very high temperatures. Further research and development cooperation is essential for the further industrialization of SOEC technology. thyssenkrupp nucera and the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems IKTS signed a strategic partnership in March of this year. Since then, they have been working together to develop the highly innovative high-temperature electrolysis (SOEC) to market maturity. In more than 20 years of extensive research and development work, the renowned Fraunhofer IKTS has laid the foundations for SOEC technology and thus carried out the necessary preliminary work with a view to industrializing this electrolysis technology. thyssenkrupp nucera and Fraunhofer IKTS are working together to take the next steps in high-temperature electrolysis (SOEC) towards industrial application. SOEC technology offers companies a very high level of energy efficiency. Industries with production processes that generate industrial waste heat, such as the steel industry, can particularly benefit from this. Utilizing this waste heat in high-temperature electrolysis significantly reduces electricity consumption, making this electrolysis technology to an important technology for users in thyssenkrupp nucera’s portfolio.

ABBs perspective on decarbonising operations throughout industries that suit best in the long run, their presence throughout regions and how the cost of production can be cut down are some of the many aspects that you will find interesting to read about in this exclusive interview with Power Info Today. Green hydrogen can and must play a significant role as a new energy source to help decarbonize industry, especially in applications where it is unavoidable, such as ammonia for fertilizers, e-methanol for e-fuels for transport, and e-methane for power generation and heating. It also plays a key role in hard to abate sectors, such as iron and steel production, for the iron ore reduction process, as well as the pulp and paper and cement industries where its use is fundamental to the process for the reduction of CO2 emissions. ABB is firmly committed to helping accelerate and enable the hydrogen market and believes that it has potential to play a key role in the energy transition. This has clearly been recognized in Denmark which is strongly poised for hydrogen development and expected to be one of the top producers of low-emissions hydrogen in northwest Europe by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. The Government has set a goal to install 4–6 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030 to produce green hydrogen. Firstly, we need to speed up scale on electrolyzer capacity so that we can maintain momentum on green hydrogen projects. By doing so, we can reduce the cost, which is critical given that electrolyzers account for the majority share of the CAPEX. The ambition is there, with manufacturers announcing plans to expand to 155 GW per year[1] of manufacturing capacity by 2030, an 11-fold increase from the approximate 14 GW available today. Secondly, we need to support the integration of electrolyzers into the process to enhance efficiency, and therefore help optimize the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), which is the main priority. ABB supports our customers in this area with a tailored three-step process which assesses the design principles of the electrical architecture and the technology selection criteria. This allows for a standardized and modularized Balance of Plant (BoP), which includes everything upstream, downstream and around the electrolyzer. The BoP is the building block by which hydrogen projects are scaled, but it needs to account for a project’s specific need to achieve this. Success will require continuous innovation and testing to improve performance metrics for electrolyzers. This is why we’ve formed an alliance with Danish company Topsoe and US engineering and construction company Fluor to support a standardized concept for electrolyzer production which will help address this by reducing cost and improving efficiencies. Also, for green hydrogen to become more easily accepted, the LCOH needs to be competitive. To put this into context, around 70 percent of the total operating costs required to make green hydrogen are estimated to come from the renewable electricity needed to power the electrolyzers. For hydrogen to increase its role as a driver of decarbonization – and scale up to the gigawatt levels required – it must achieve cost parity with other processes. ABB is proud to be involved in this project – the world’s first dynamic green power-to-ammonia plant – in West Jutland, which was officially inaugurated in August 2024. We are responsible for the electrical integration and advanced process control of the plant. It  operates in a highly dynamic mode, which means that production is enabled only when renewable energy is available and gears down when no renewable energy source is present. This allows it to adapt to fluctuations in energy supply and differentiates it from other types of power-to-X plants, which are directly connected to the grid. It is an important development for the region in enabling stable and reliable control and integration of renewables to power low carbon fuel production facilities. Also, if scaled it is expected a lower OPEX can be achieved which can provide a blueprint to build more dynamic and cost-optimized plants in the future. ABB is working with partners around the world to automate, electrify, optimize and decarbonize industrial operations, especially in hard-to-abate sectors, in a leaner and cleaner way. At ABB we call this ‘Engineered to Outrun’. By optimizing operations, we can unlock the economic and environmental benefits of green hydrogen. At ABB we believe that the greenest energy is the energy you don’t use, which is why last year we launched our energy management system ABB Ability™ OPTIMAX® specifically for green hydrogen. It strategically directs energy flows and assets to ensure that industrial processes run in the most efficient way possible with minimal l\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Eco Expo Asia 2024 strengthens global dialogue on green technologies and environmental solutions\n","Link: https://www.powerinfotoday.com/news-press-releases/eco-expo-asia-2024-strengthens-global-dialogue-on-green-technologies-and-environmental-solutions/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Hong Kong. The 19th edition of Eco Expo Asia was successfully held from 30 October to 2 November 2024 at AsiaWorld-Expo in Hong Kong.

It’s the headquarters for the Center for Energy Education, the nonprofit Lowe has run since 2016 that works to maximize the benefits of large solar farms in rural America — one community, one school child, and one worker at a time.  Lowe, who grew up about five miles from where she now works, had graduated from Greensboro’s North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University but worked across the country, from California to Washington, D.C.  When she returned to this rural county of less than 50,000 near the Virginia border, formerly a hub of farming and textiles, she said she didn’t see a lot of change.   “The jobs were the same,” she said. “I didn’t see people making the connection between solar energy and what’s happening with the climate and the impact on rural communities, and I just wanted to try and help from that angle.”  The Center conducts educational programs for children of all ages, who come in by the busload from surrounding schools both public and private. It holds a Solar Fest every year to celebrate clean energy with community leaders, drawing hundreds. Through collaborations with local educational institutions like community colleges, the center has also helped to train a new workforce in jobs that pay roughly twice what workers are earning at the fast-food chains off Interstate 95.  “We have trained more people than most other people around here to become solar installers,” Lowe said. “We want them to be first in line for our jobs.” And there’s outreach to solar companies themselves in North Carolina as well as Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana, where the Center also has offices. The goal is to help them become better community partners. Geenex, the Charlotte-based developer who built the solar farm at the airport and over a dozen others in the vicinity, is still involved in the Center, and the company’s chairman also chairs the nonprofit’s board.   But Lowe and other staff at the organization say not every solar developer is committed — at least at first — to working with community leaders in Eastern North Carolina.  “Geenex is a very good partner,” said Reginald Bynum, the Center’s community outreach manager. “They’re a good player. But there are only a few of them. Other companies will say, ‘This is your ordinance? Great. This is all I have to do.’”  Some county ordinances, like that in Halifax, need to be updated, Bynum said. Many still call for a 75-foot buffer between the rows of solar panels and neighboring properties. That figure is “so 2018,” said Bynum. It should be doubled, he said.  Most solar farms are also built on private land — often bits of farmland that can help cotton growers and other farmers guarantee income. But developers usually obtain the leases first, before airing the project in public.  “That’s the backwards process of solar,” Bynum said. “They’re talking to landowners and securing that land, and then they’re coming to commissioners.”  What’s more, simply following ordinances isn’t enough, Bynum says. What’s needed is for solar developers to work with local residents to develop community benefits agreements — documents that memorialize pluses to the area, from minimizing construction impacts to providing jobs.  “It’s a 30-year commitment to the community,” he said, “because your farm’s going to be here 30 years. They’re asking for that, and they deserve that.”  Critically, say Bynum and other advocates, solar developers need to work with community leaders to provide benefits beyond tax revenue — an undeniable good, but one that isn’t “seen” by anyone except county bookkeepers. And though a recent study from the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association shows that solar farms today take up a fraction of a percent of the state’s farmland, the figure is a full 1% in Halifax County, and on pace to triple in the coming years, according to the Center’s research.  “From rural citizens’ standpoint, that’s a lot,” Bynum said. “You have to really understand what they’re seeing.”  Part of what they’re seeing is the result of a simple fact: solar farms aren’t just growing more abundant in parts of rural America. They’re also much larger. In North Carolina up until 2016, the average utility-scale solar development was 5.8 megawatts covering 35 acres of land, per the Sustainable Energy Association. After a 2017 state law made larger solar farms easier to build, the average system size increased to 13.6 megawatts and covered 115 acres of land. “\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: How the Renewable Energy Boom Is Remaking the American West\n","Link: https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/solar/how-the-renewable-energy-boom-is-remaking-the-american-west/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","By Jimmy Tobias | Inside Climate News This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here. This article was produced in partnership with the nonprofit newsroom Type Investigations, with support from the Puffin Foundation.  ON HIGHWAY 50, Nev.—Local conservationist Patrick Donnelly drove east along the Loneliest Road in America, a ribbon of pavement in north central Nevada that deserves its name. Before him, sprawling in every direction, was a green-gray sagebrush basin so large you could probably plop Las Vegas in it and still have room to spare. Save for a stiff wind and the occasional cow bleat, a heavy silence sat on the valley. Not much moved aside from skittish grouse and a few scattered cars. This is a place, a big open hunk of public land, where humans haven’t made an intensive mark.  At least not yet. In corporate conference rooms and government offices from Vegas to Washington, D.C., policymakers, executives and lobbyists are planning a very different future for valleys like this one. If their plans become reality, vast swaths of undeveloped land across Nevada could soon be crossed by towering transmission lines and studded with solar farms in the name of fighting climate change.  The Biden administration has made an aggressive drive to permit 25 gigawatts of renewable energy on America’s federal lands by 2025, which the U.S. Department of the Interior says is enough to power 12 million homes. It surpassed that goal in April. In August this year, it also proposed a solar plan that would make more than 31 million acres of federal land across the American West available for potential solar development. Even before Donald Trump’s victory in the November election, the Biden administration has been rushing to push through as many renewable energy projects as it can. Trump has promised to place more emphasis on oil and gas development, and at an October 2024 roundtable with Latino voters he criticized the impact that solar development has on the desert, saying “it’s all steel and glass and wires. It looks like hell. … And what it does to your desert areas or the areas that you are putting it, it’s just crazy.” Yet during Trump’s first term, his administration did approve a number of major solar projects on federal land, including the controversial Yellow Pine project near Pahrump, Nevada. And some experts doubt that he will completely roll back the ongoing renewable energy boom in the American West. “I don’t think there is much of a difference between Trump and Biden on solar, renewables and public lands,” said Dustin Mulvaney, a professor and sustainable energy expert at San José State University. “The clean energy industry plays both sides in the election. Public lands for renewable energy has been pretty bipartisan.” Nevada, where the federal government manages more than 80 percent of the land, is a key theater for such development—nearly 12 million acres are eligible for it under the Biden administration’s solar plan, approximately 17 percent of the state. More than one-third of the solar and wind proposals pending before the federal Bureau of Land Management nationwide, meanwhile, are located in Nevada.  Donnelly, an environmental activist with the Center for Biological Diversity, is deeply troubled by this federally backed plan. He has spent years defending Nevada’s wild places and endangered animals from developers of all kinds—mining groups, oil and gas drillers, real estate firms and agricultural interests. But now he sees a major new threat at the hands of the renewable energy industry, whose growing power and presence was on display during his road trip. All across the state, solar farms, geothermal projects, lithium mines, transmission lines and more are being planned on undeveloped public lands.  “We are talking about a fundamental transformation of the American West,” said Donnelly. At the center of this push is NV Energy, which provides around 90 percent of the state with electricity and is a subsidiary of magnate Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Energy. The company wants to build two enormous transmission lines on federal property in Nevada. If completed in the coming years, these projects, known as Greenlink West and Greenlink North, would span more than 700 miles in the state, most of it federal land. They will help make NV Energy a dominant player in the emerging renewable energy system of the western United States.  The company has said the lines will create a “renewable energy highway that allows access to Nevada’s resource rich renewable energy zones.” It also says the lines will generate $690 million in economic activity.  Greenlink West, which received federal approval in September, is slated to be in service by the end of May 2027, NV Energy says. Greenlink North, still undergoing federal review, is targeted for late 2028.  Many government officia\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Federal hostility could delay offshore wind projects, derailing state climate goals\n","Link: https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wind-power/offshore/federal-hostility-could-delay-offshore-wind-projects-derailing-state-climate-goals/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","by Alex Brown, Stateline Numerous East Coast states are counting on offshore wind projects to power tens of millions of homes and to help them transition to cleaner energy. But putting wind turbines at sea requires the cooperation of a powerful landlord: the federal government. Soon, that government will be led by President-elect Donald Trump, who has frequently disparaged offshore wind and said he will “make sure that ends on Day 1.” In the eight states that have passed legal mandates to reach certain amounts of offshore wind power, Trump’s second term threatens those timelines. “This is absolutely going to create problems for how we’re going to meet our emissions goals and the energy needs for the state,” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who serves as vice chair on the legislative Joint Committee on Environment and Natural Resources. For many East Coast states that lack a large land base for extensive onshore development, offshore wind in federal ocean waters is central to their plans for a power supply that doesn’t use fossil fuels. Lawmakers in Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Virginia have established mandates requiring their states to produce certain amounts of offshore wind power in the coming years. Other states have passed laws to allow for offshore wind to be added to their grids or set nonbinding planning targets to prepare for the industry’s development. State leaders say they will continue to pursue offshore wind but realize there may be delays during the next four years. In the meantime, some say they will continue to build out the needed electrical grid and ports to get ready for turbines, in hopes of speeding up offshore wind once Trump’s term ends. Others say they may need to consider building more onshore energy projects, including wind and solar, in the next few years to meet near-term climate goals. “That’s something states will have to take into account,” said Dylan McDowell, executive director with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a collaborative nonpartisan forum for state lawmakers. “Is [offshore wind] still feasible, or do there need to be conversations about solar, [onshore] wind, geothermal, other energy sources that could be put into the mix to help meet those goals? There’s more questions than there are answers right now.” While a handful of offshore wind projects have already started construction or been completed, many more are in various stages of permitting or awaiting lease auctions held by the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Industry experts say the Trump administration could deny permits, cancel pending leases and halt further auctions. It could also threaten the industry’s financing by denying clean energy tax credits. In an extreme scenario, the bureau could even side with opponents who have brought legal challenges against projects that already have been approved and retract permits issued under the Biden administration. Trump’s ability to unwind the moves made under President Joe Biden is “underappreciated,” said Timothy Fox, a vice president at ClearView Energy Partners LLC, an independent research firm. Trump has repeated claims that offshore wind turbines are a major cause of whale mortality — an assertion that scientists say is false. Many of the groups raising concerns about whales to oppose offshore wind are funded by oil and gas donors. Trump’s transition team did not respond to an interview request before publication. Offshore wind also has drawn local opposition from coastal residents who fear it will worsen their views and from fishermen who worry projects could block access to key fishing areas. Meanwhile, some Republicans have pointed to the wind industry’s recent financial struggles to argue that it will increase ratepayers’ bills. “[T]he business model for these projects has fallen well short of projections to the degree that those wind energy developers are either halting construction or asking the government for additional subsidies to make up for projected cost increases,” four Maryland Republican senators wrote to Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in April, unsuccessfully urging him to veto a financing package to boost offshore wind in that state. States’ offshore wind goals were already facing difficulties. Numerous projects were canceled or delayed last year as inflation and supply chain issues raised costs dramatically. Now, political headwinds could cause greater delays. “Offshore wind might not be a viable option over the next four years,” said Fox, the energy analyst. “Unlike a lot of other resources, offshore wind is reliant on a federal review process because these projects are being deployed in federal waters.” Offshore wind turbines currently provide only a negligible amount of power to the United States. But a handful of projects currently under construction will soon raise that number to 4 gigawatts (1 gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes)\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Vistra connects two new solar projects, delays coal plant closure in Illinois\n","Link: https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/solar/utility-scale/vistra-connects-two-new-solar-projects-extends-life-of-1185-mw-baldwin-coal-plant-in-illinois/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Vistra announced that two new utility-scale solar projects in Illinois have connected to the grid and that, amid what it called “widespread concern over reliability” in the MISO market, it is pushing back the retirement of its 1,185-megawatt (MW) Baldwin Power Plant in Baldwin, Illinois. The company said it now intends to run the Baldwin plant through 2027 instead of retiring in 2025, as previously announced, while still meeting federal Environmental Protection Agency retirement and pond closure obligations.    “Vistra is committed to the responsible transition of our fleet in Illinois, and in this case, the most reasonable path forward is to continue to operate the plant as a reliable bridge to 2027, as we, and others, bring new generation assets online in the state,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “As many organizations have recently raised concerns over reliability and resource adequacy in central and southern Illinois, we are taking action and delivering solutions that balance the needs of reliability, affordability, and sustainability.” With the addition of a new 68 MW utility-scale solar and 2 MW/8 MWh energy storage system, which began generating power this month, Baldwin is now more of a power generation hub than a traditional power plant. The $135-million investment involved the placement of over 200,000 solar panels across 420 acres of property the plant has owned and maintained for decades. The solar generation facility will produce approximately 140,000 MWh annually over the next 20 years.  The 1,185-MW Baldwin Power Plant produces enough electricity to power approximately 592,500 homes. Approximately 120 employees operate the Baldwin plant. Union employees are represented by IBEW Local 51. Across the country, Vistra is undertaking a “methodical, site-by-site analysis” of its coal fleet to determine the economic feasibility of repurposing the sites by retiring some technologies and renewing the plants with less carbon-intense generation, including solar and energy storage.  The investment at the Baldwin plant site is part of the State of Illinois’ Coal-to-Solar and Energy Storage Initiative, which encouraged the development of renewable energy assets at existing power plant sites. Along with Baldwin, Vistra continues to make progress on other Coal-to-Solar sites, including:   Separately, construction has begun on a 405 MW utility-scale solar facility that will interconnect at the company’s retired EEI-Joppa Power Plant through a to-be-constructed approximate 8-mile transmission line.  Since its merger with Dynegy in 2018, Vistra has taken steps to operate, retire, and transform its coal plant fleet in Illinois. The company has committed to retiring these plants by the end of 2027 to comply with existing federal EPA regulations.    Vistra argues that the Baldwin Power Plant provides “significant direct and indirect” economic benefits to the region and state. An economic impact study projected the plant’s direct, indirect, and induced economic benefits and concluded that within Randolph County, the existing Baldwin plant:  The new solar facility is expected to generate $6 million in total property tax payments over the project’s life, Vistra said. Last month, Vistra said it was engaged in discussions with large load customers for the potential sale of power from its nuclear and gas plants through long-term agreements. Stacey Doré, Vistra’s Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer, told investors the company was pursuing deals based around multiple plants in its portfolio. She said one approach being discussed would be pursuing co-location deals at multiple sites in combination with building new generation. Doré said Vistra specifically in discussions with two large companies about building new gas plants to support a data center project. Gas plants in both PJM and ERCOT are drawing interest, she said. The company is also in early discussions with some of the hyperscalers about nuclear uprates, Doré said.

This week’s episode features Dana Clare Redden, from our “Cleantecher of the Year” committee, who has picked our Cleantecher of the Year! The president-elect’s choice for energy secretary, Chris Wright, argues that only fossil fuels can supply energy for people in poverty, and that there are no other meaningful energy substitutes right now.  The World Bank estimates that solar mini-grids could bring electricity to 380 million Africans by 2030. A 2021 Rockefeller Foundation study found that investing in distributed renewables like rooftop solar and home batteries could create 25 million jobs in Asia and Africa by 2030—30 times more than oil, gas, or coal. A Cipher analysis finds that investments in low-carbon hydrogen, carbon capture, critical mineral processing, and sustainable aviation fuel totaled nearly $48 billion in 2022 and $42 billion in 2023, but dropped to $16.2 billion in the first three quarters of 2024. Further slowdown is expected after Trump’s election. Despite the overall decline in investments, there is one positive trend: sustainable aviation fuels mostly made from biofuels. A Boston Consulting Group analysis revealed that among the top 260 publicly listed energy companies worldwide, utilities for the first time spent slightly more on new projects than oil and gas companies, largely driven by growing demand for data centers. U.S. utilities added $50 billion in planned capex during Q3 alone. Oil and gas companies are also prioritizing returning money to shareholders by exploring ways to directly power data centers without connecting to the grid so ratepayers don’t have to foot the bill. Watch the full episode on YouTube Pacific Gas & Electric, California’s largest utility serving roughly 16 million people, was offered a record $15 billion loan guarantee from the DOE to improve its electrical grid and fund climate resiliency projects. This loan will enable PG&E to invest in hydroelectric power, batteries, and power lines, reducing electricity costs for consumers while meeting the rising demand from EV adoption, data centers, and the transition away from fossil fuels. Just this month, the Public Advocate’s Office reported that PG&E had the highest rate increases among California’s investor-owned utilities. PG&E’s rates rose 56% over three years and 118% over 10 years. However, this loan could save ratepayers as much as $1 billion.

FERC is seeking $722 million in civil penalties and the return of over $253 million in unjust profits to PJM and MISO.  How’s that for an attention-grabber on an otherwise mild holiday week? Do you think FERC prefers cash or check? The case revolves around definitions of eligible energy efficiency projects that may be entitled to capacity payments. The order alleges that American Efficient, which bills itself as one of the largest energy efficiency aggregators in the United States yet has a LinkedIn page that shows up as no longer available, violated Section 222 of the Federal Power Act (FPA) and FERC regulations through a manipulative scheme in PJM and MISO capacity markets. The proposed penalty of $722 million is more than 43 times larger than the total civil penalties of $16.68 million FERC reported this year. It follows through on a letter the agency issued this June indicating it was poised to take action against American Efficient’s PJM subsidiary, Affirmed Energy. The alleged violations involve extracting millions of dollars in capacity payments for supposed “energy efficiency projects” that, according to the Commission, did not actually reduce energy use and failed to meet tariff requirements regarding measurements and validation for participation as an Energy Efficiency Resource (EER). Through the capacity markets, American Efficiency allegedly monetized numerous independent customer decisions to purchase energy efficient products at retail by buying the sales data and, purportedly, “environmental attributes” from various retailers, manufacturers, and distributors including Walmart, GE-Current, and Stop and Shop, then seeking capacity payments from PJM and MISO capacity markets for the energy reductions associated with the customers’ anticipated use of those products.  According to the show cause order, American Efficient’s program receives more capacity payments than any other single generator in PJM and offers nothing in return. FERC’s investigation into this matter began in May 2021. Various investigative techniques were implemented, including reviewing American Efficient’s submissions to the ISOs/RTOs, analyzing capacity auction results, and examining the company’s measurement and verification (M&V) plans and post-installation M&V reports. Enforcement staff also scrutinized American Efficient’s relationships with finance partners, including an investment bank, its affiliate, and an investment company. They took a look at American Efficient’s decade-long history of EER participation in PJM and MISO related to Energy Efficiency Resources (EERs) as well as attempts to expand its program to ISO-NE and the subsequent rejection by that RTO. The investigation covered financial transactions, market participation data, and communications between American Efficient and the relevant ISOs/RTOs. Enforcement staff claim American Efficient refused to cooperate with its investigation, declining to make witnesses available for interviews and/or sworn testimony. After converting the preliminary investigation into a formal investigation, enforcement staff took testimony from two company employees and two former company executives. Staff also allege that American Efficient provided misleading information to FERC. Law firm Van Ness Feldman LLP believes the massive sum of the proposed penalty indicates either FERC’s views on the severity of the alleged violations or on the behavior of the company during the investigation. American Efficient denied the allegations in a letter to FERC Commissioners, In which American Efficient subsidiary Affirmed Energy called it “unjust to target one company for punishment and loss of its business through an enforcement investigation into what (the FERC) publicly alleges is standard industry practice.” American Efficient must respond to the allegations within the next 30 days and show cause as to why they should not be found in violation of the FPA and FERC regulations. The order also requires the respondents to choose between an immediate penalty assessment with a right to a de novo trial in court and an administrative hearing before a FERC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).  It remains unclear whether the Supreme Court’s decision in SEC v. Jarkesy will affect these proceedings, observes Van Ness Feldman. Under the FPA, respondents can contest any penalty assessment in a de novo trial in a federal district court. The Jarkesy decision suggests that a proceeding before an ALJ would violate the Seventh Amendment if respondents were required to go before an ALJ. However, under the FPA, respondents are not “required” but have the option to pursue an administrative hearing before an ALJ. It is uncertain how a federal\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Ameren Missouri brings 500 MW of new solar online\n","Link: https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/solar/utility-scale/ameren-missouri-brings-500-mw-of-new-solar-online/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Ameren Missouri announced 500 megawatts (MW) of new solar generation, representing a total investment of approximately $950 million, are now online and serving customers. The three facilities are the 200-MW Huck Finn Renewable Energy Center, the 150-MW Boomtown Renewable Energy Center and the 150-MW Cass County Renewable Energy Center. Both the Cass County and Boomtown facilities will serve Ameren Missouri’s Renewable Solutions program. Organizations from across Missouri signed up to take part in the program, increasing their use of renewable energy and supporting its development in the region. As part of the program, participating organizations will also receive renewable energy credits. Ameren Missouri is also working toward the construction of additional new sources of energy. In 2027, an 800-MW simple-cycle natural gas energy center is expected to be ready to serve as a backup source of energy. The Castle Bluff Energy Center represents an investment of approximately $900 million, and its proposed site previously hosted the coal-fired Meramec Energy Center, which Ameren closed in 2022. The utility owns the property and already has existing infrastructure and transmission line access, reducing the construction costs of the project, Ameren said. Pending regulatory approval, construction would begin in 2026. Last October, Ameren released its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan, which included investments in natural gas, renewables and battery storage.

This week the eponymous search engine giant announced a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Charlottesville, Virginia-based Apex Clean Energy for the full 79.3 megawatt (MW) capacity of Rocky Forge Wind.  The proposed 13-turbine undertaking would be the Commonwealth of Virginia’s first onshore wind farm. Plans call for the project to be erected atop North Mountain, outside the rural town of Eagle Rock in Botetourt County. Construction on the long-delayed project (its website targets operations in 2022) is now set to start in 2025, and Apex hopes to be selling electrons by 2026. “Rocky Forge represents a new chapter in Virginia’s energy transition, delivering lasting economic and environmental benefits to Apex’s home state while advancing Google’s sustainability goals,” said Eamon Perrel, Apex executive vice president of business development. “Google—alongside many key stakeholders over the years—enabled this milestone, demonstrating the power of partnership in accelerating the shift to clean energy.” Google’s PPA represents a significant milestone not just for Apex, but for the Commonwealth of Virginia as well, which has navigated its fair share of hiccups along the path to securing an offtaker. In October 2019, Dominion Energy announced plans to purchase Rocky Forge’s power as part of a 420 MW procurement in pursuit of Virginia’s clean energy targets. The contract expired and was not renewed.  According to Virginia Business, the project picked up momentum this year after a series of legal decisions fell in its favor. In January, a circuit court judge dismissed two lawsuits against the project. Then in September, the Virginia Court of Appeals upheld a circuit court ruling that had approved the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality’s permit for Apex, paving the way for progress on the site to resume. Apex anticipates Rocky Forge, one of the few wind projects in PJM territory, will generate up to 250 jobs during construction and approximately $30 million in state and local tax revenue over its lifetime. This partnership is the second between Apex and Google, following last year’s deal for all the power from another historic onshore wind project, the first in North Carolina– Timbermill Wind. Via an offtake agreement unveiled last August, Google will purchase the entire 189 MW capacity of the project, located in Chowan County. The power from the project’s 45 turbines will help fuel Google’s data center operations, like Rocky Forge Wind. Google was the third-largest corporate offtaker of clean energy in 2024, trailing only Meta and Amazon, procuring more than 2.5 GW. Although it was the first commercial wind project approved by North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality, Timbermill Wind was the second to be built, following the 208 MW Amazon Wind US East (also known as the Desert Wind Farm) project commissioned by Iberdrola subsidiary Avangrid earlier this year. That project has an offtake agreement with Amazon. Apex recently secured financing for Timbermill Wind, which celebrated the start of operations this week. CEO Ken Young called it a pivotal milestone in North Carolina’s energy transition. “Amid a complex permitting landscape, Timbermill was enabled by strong community support, visionary partnerships, and deep development expertise,” he added. Earlier this week, Apex also announced support of its fifth project in Illinois, the 300 MW Prosperity Wind facility in Piatt County, following the execution of tax equity commitments from lead investor J.P. Morgan and another undisclosed, well-known U.S.-based investor.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Fervo Energy secures additional $255 million funding to meet unprecedented energy demand\n","Link: https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/baseload/geothermal/fervo-energy-secures-additional-255-million-funding-to-meet-unprecedented-energy-demand/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","Fervo Energy is ending 2024 much like how it started it- raising hundreds of millions of dollars in financing to support its next-generation geothermal projects. Today Fervo announced that it has secured $255 million in new funding and capital availability comprising both opportunistic corporate equity and new debt financing. Capricorn’s Technology Impact Fund II led the $135 million corporate equity round, which also included Breakthrough Energy Ventures, CalSTRS, Congruent Ventures, CPP Investments, DCVC, Devon Energy, Galvanize Climate Solutions, Liberty Mutual Investments, Mercuria, and Sabanci Climate Ventures. “The demand for 24/7 carbon-free energy is at an all-time high, and Fervo is one of the only companies building large projects that will come online before the end of the decade,” noted Fervo CEO and cofounder Tim Latimer. “Investors recognize that Fervo’s ability to get to scale quickly is vital in an evolving market that is seeing unprecedented energy demand from AI and other sources.” In addition to corporate equity, Fervo secured a $120 million letter of credit and term loan facility from Mercuria, one of the world’s largest independent energy and commodity groups. The facility will provide additional liquidity for Fervo to accelerate the deployment of EGS projects across the U.S. as it seeks to meet skyrocketing demand for clean, firm power.  A new report from consulting firm Grid Strategies shows that over the past two years, the five-year load growth forecast has increased by almost a factor of five, from 23 gigawatts (GW) to 128 GW. According to Strategic Industries Surging: Driving US Power Demand, nationwide electric demand is forecast to increase by 15.8% by 2029. “In surveying power markets across the U.S. today, the need for next-generation geothermal is undeniable,” said Brian Falik, Group Chief Investment Officer of Mercuria. “We believe in Fervo not just because their EGS approach is cost-effective, commercially viable, and already being deployed at scale, but because they set ambitious targets and consistently deliver.” Fervo’s first greenfield development, Cape Station, was recently approved by the Bureau of Land Management and is now fully permitted up to 2 GW. The project produces energy by injecting water into hot subsurface rock formations and then extracting the heated water to generate electricity, rather than depending on naturally occurring underground hot water like traditional geothermal systems. It will begin generating electricity in 2026. In February, Fervo Energy announced that it had raised $244 million in new funding led by Devon Energy, meant to enable Fervo’s next phase of growth. Galvanize Climate Solutions, John Arnold, Liberty Mutual Investments, Marunouchi Innovation Partners, Mercuria, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries also joined the round alongside existing investors Capricorn’s Technology Impact Fund, Congruent Ventures, DCVC, Elemental Excelerator, Helmerich & Payne, and Impact Science Ventures. This fall, Fervo joined forces with Southern Utah University (SUU) and non-profit investment platform Elemental Impact on a first-of-its-kind geothermal apprenticeship program to help oil and gas workers and Southwest Utah residents join the rapidly growing industry. The program will be administered by SUU and funded in part by Elemental. By the end of the year, it aims to enroll at least 40 apprentices and enable them with new skill sets, providing an opportunity to fill an immediate workforce need upon completion. The program will combine on-the-job training with college-level coursework on geology and energy systems, offering a unique pathway for both typical college students and adults already in the workforce to learn more about careers in geothermal.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Title: Here’s where Key Capture wants to develop two utility-scale batteries for Long Island Power Authority\n","Link: https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/storage/grid-scale/heres-where-key-capture-wants-to-develop-two-utility-scale-batteries-for-long-island-power-authority/\n","Extracted Main Content:\n","On Wednesday the Long Island Power Authority Board of Trustees approved two battery energy storage contracts in Suffolk County, New York that will provide much-needed reliability to the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) grid. If granted final approval from the Towns of Islip and Brookhaven, battery energy storage developer Key Capture Energy (KCE) will build and operate a utility-scale lithium-iron-phosphate battery energy storage system (BESS) in Hauppauge, New York, and another in Shoreham, NY, both under long-term contracts with LIPA. Here’s what we know about each BESS and how their construction affects ratepayers: KCE NY 29 – Hauppauge, New York The KCE NY 29 project in Hauppauge will sell LIPA 79 megawatts (MW) and 316 megawatt-hours (MWh) of capacity. A 12-foot-high barrier wall will be installed to serve as a sound barrier and landscaping will be added around the perimeter to further reduce the project’s visibility. KCE NY 29 will connect to the Kings Substation and is expected to be completed by 2028. Over its 20-year contract, the cost to the average LIPA residential ratepayer will be $0.19 per month, according to LIPA.  KCE NY 31 – Shoreham, New York The KCE NY 31 project in Shoreham is being developed on a portion of the former Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, which LIPA owns. LIPA will purchase a guaranteed 50 MW and 200 MWh of capacity from the project, which will connect to the Shoreham Substation and is expected to be completed by 2028. Over its 20-year contract, KCE NY 31’s cost to the average LIPA residential ratepayer will be $0.11 per month.  Submit a case study! We want to hear about what you’re working on. Submit a case study with the chance to be featured in Renewable Energy World.  LIPA contends these BESS will serve as critical resources to meet its clean energy goals and the reliability needs for Long Island and the Rockaways. “Energy storage is essential to delivering reliable and affordable power as we increasingly switch to renewable energy sources and electrify our buildings and transportation systems. Integrating storage in the electric grid, especially in areas with high energy demand, will allow clean energy to be available when and where it is most needed,” explained John Rhodes, acting chief executive officer of LIPA.  “These projects are critically valuable for our electric grid and will be valuable additions to our power supply portfolio.” These facilities will be especially critical, LIPA notes, as the needs of the local electric grid change to prepare for additional offshore wind generation and the retirements of existing fossil fuel peaking plants. “The electric grid will need flexible solutions that can respond quickly when needed, given the intermittency of renewable generation, and discharge during peak demand hours to enhance reliability,” LIPA confirmed. Both Key Capture projects are executed under “Energy Storage Build-Own-Operate-Optional Transfer Agreements,” which gives LIPA the option to purchase the projects in the future.  New York has set a target of 70% of the state’s electricity being produced from renewable resources by 2030, with the additional goal of achieving a 100% carbon-free grid. Its Climate Act targets included a 3,000 MW statewide energy storage goal, which has since been expanded to 6,000 MW by the New York Public Service Commission. Through a 2021 Bulk Storage Request for Proposals, LIPA intends to meet its share of these goals by procuring approximately 175 MW of new bulk energy storage contracts. The Key Capture storage systems will use lithium-iron-phosphate batteries with a discharge duration of four hours, common for such installations. Fires at smaller battery storage facilities incorporating lithium batteries on Long Island and New York State have highlighted the need to adequately address fire safety, including measures to prevent and respond to battery storage fires. Last year, to address these incidents, Governor Kathy Hochul announced the creation of an Inter-Agency Fire Safety Working Group to ensure the safety and security of energy storage. Key Capture says these two LIPA projects have incorporated all the Working Group’s recommendations to date. Key Capture Energy and PSEG Long Island, LIPA’s service provider, conducted public outreach for both projects, including with local fire marshals and hazmat coordinators. The contracts will now be sent to the New York State Attorney General and Office of State Comptroller for approval before state and local permits can be issued.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Total Articles Extracted: 65\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n","import itertools\n","\n","# Function to compute similarity and find top 10 similar articles\n","def find_top_similar_articles(articles, top_n=10):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Compare main content and title of news articles and find the top N most similar pairs.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","    articles (list): A list of tuples containing site_name, title, main_content, and link.\n","    top_n (int): Number of top similar article pairs to return.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","    list: A list of tuples containing the similarity score and the two article details.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if len(articles) < 2:\n","        print(\"Not enough articles to compare.\")\n","        return []\n","\n","    # Combine title and main content for comparison\n","    combined_texts = [f\"{title} {main_content}\" for _, title, main_content, _ in articles]\n","\n","    # Generate TF-IDF matrix\n","    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')\n","    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(combined_texts)\n","\n","    # Compute pairwise cosine similarity\n","    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix)\n","\n","    # Generate all possible pairs and their similarity scores\n","    article_pairs = []\n","    for i, j in itertools.combinations(range(len(articles)), 2):\n","        similarity_score = similarity_matrix[i, j]\n","        article_pairs.append((similarity_score, articles[i], articles[j]))\n","\n","    # Sort by similarity score in descending order and get top N\n","    top_similar_articles = sorted(article_pairs, key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)[:top_n]\n","\n","    return top_similar_articles\n","\n","# Sample Usage\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    # Assuming all_articles is already populated with (site_name, title, main_content, link)\n","    # all_articles = [(site_name, title, main_content, link), ...]\n","\n","    print(\"Comparing articles for similarity...\")\n","    top_similarities = find_top_similar_articles(all_articles, top_n=10)\n","\n","    print(\"\\nTop 10 Most Similar Articles:\")\n","    for idx, (score, article1, article2) in enumerate(top_similarities, start=1):\n","        print(f\"\\n{idx}.
