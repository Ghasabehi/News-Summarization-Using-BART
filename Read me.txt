Project Title: News Content Summarization Using BART
Project Description
This project focuses on extracting, comparing, and summarizing news articles from multiple sources using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It automates the process of fetching news content via RSS feeds, analyzing similarities between articles, and generating coherent summaries using the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model.

The primary features of the project include:

News Extraction:

Fetches news articles from multiple trusted RSS feeds, such as Renewable Energy World, Energy News Network, and Power Engineering.
Extracts the main content and titles from the retrieved articles.
Similarity Analysis:

Compares the main content of articles to find the most similar ones.
Identifies top similar articles to enable focused analysis on trending or related topics.
Summarization with BART:

Summarizes the main content of individual articles using Facebook's BART model for Conditional Generation.
Provides concise and informative summaries that capture the essence of the articles.
Report Generation:

Generates comprehensive and cohesive reports by combining summaries of top articles.
Allows for easy storage and sharing of summarized data.
Integration with Google Drive:

Saves generated summaries and reports directly to Google Drive for seamless accessibility.
Outputs in text format for easy readability and integration with other tools.
GitHub Collaboration:

Designed for collaboration and open-source contributions.
Encourages developers to enhance the codebase for broader use cases.
This project showcases how advanced machine learning models like BART can simplify the process of news aggregation, analysis, and summarization, making it a valuable tool for researchers, analysts, and content creators.
